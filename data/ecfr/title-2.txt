ASUBPARTSubpart A—General25.100SECTION1§ 25.100   Purpose of this part.This part provides guidance to Federal agencies that:
(a) The unique entity identifier (UEI) is the universal identifier for Federal financial assistance applicants, as well as recipients and their direct subrecipients (first-tier subrecipients), and;
(b) The System for Award Management () is the repository for standard information about applicants and recipients.




SAM.gov25.105SECTION1§ 25.105   Applicability.(a) This part applies to a Federal agency's Federal financial assistance as defined in § 25.400. This part applies to all applicants for and recipients of Federal financial assistance unless exempted by Federal statute or § 25.110.
(b) Subrecipients are required to obtain a UEI in accordance with subpart C. This part does not apply to subrecipients of subrecipients (second-tier subrecipients) or contractors under Federal awards.
(c) This part does not apply to an individual who applies for or receives Federal financial assistance as a natural person (unrelated to any business or nonprofit organization an individual owns or operates).
(d) Because this part applies to loan guarantees and other guaranteed programs, recipients of the guarantee from the Federal agency (for example, lenders of guaranteed loans) are required to complete entity validations and acquire a UEI. Additionally, at the Federal agency's discretion, non-individual beneficiary borrowers (for example, small businesses or corporations) may be required by the Federal agency to obtain a UEI or register in 




SAM.gov.25.110SECTION1§ 25.110   Exceptions to this part.(a)  (1) Under a condition identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a Federal agency may exempt an applicant or recipient of Federal financial assistance from the requirement to obtain a UEI, register in , or both.
General exceptions.SAM.gov(i) If a Federal agency grants an exception under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the Federal agency must use a generic entity identifier in the data it reports to  if reporting for a prime award of Federal financial assistance to the recipient is required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (Pub. L. 109-282, as amended, hereafter cited as “Transparency Act”). Granting an exception under paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not impact a Federal agency's responsibility for reporting under the Transparency Act, except that it may use a generic entity identifier in the circumstances described.
USAspending.gov(ii) Federal agencies should use generic entity identifiers rarely as it prevents recipients from fulfilling reporting requirements such as subaward or executive compensation reporting required by the Transparency Act.
(2) A Federal agency may exempt an applicant, recipient, or subrecipient when:
(i) The Federal agency determines that it must protect information about the entity from disclosure in the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States or to avoid jeopardizing the personal safety of the entity's staff, partners, beneficiaries, and participants;
(ii)(A) All of the following conditions are met:
() The entity is a foreign organization or foreign public entity;
1() The Federal award or subaward will be performed outside the United States;
2() The Federal award or subaward will be less than $25,000; and
3() The Federal agency deems it to be impractical for the entity to comply with the requirements of this part.
4(B) The Federal agency must determine this exemption on a case-by-case basis while utilizing a risk-based approach;
(iii) For applicants or recipients, the Federal agency may exempt foreign organizations or foreign public entities from completing full registration in  for a Federal award less than $500,000 that will be performed outside the United States. Foreign organizations or foreign public entities exempted from registering in  under this provision must still obtain a UEI. The Federal agency must determine this exemption on a case-by-case basis while utilizing a risk-based approach; or
SAM.govSAM.gov(iv) For applicants, the Federal agency determines that there are exigent circumstances that prohibit the applicant from receiving a UEI and registering in  before receiving a Federal award. In these instances, Federal agencies must require the recipient to obtain a UEI and complete registration in  within 30 days of the Federal award date.
SAM.govSAM.gov(b)  OMB may approve additional exceptions for classes of Federal awards, applicants, or recipients subject to the requirements of this part when exceptions are not prohibited by statute.

(b) The notice of funding opportunity, regulation, or other issuance must require each applicant that does not have an exemption under § 25.110 to:
(1) Be registered in  before submitting an application;
SAM.gov(2) Maintain a current and active registration in  at all times during which it has an active Federal award as a recipient or an application under consideration by a Federal agency.

If applicable, this includes identifying the applicant's or recipient's immediate and highest-level owner and subsidiaries, as well as providing information on all predecessors that have received a Federal award or contract within the last three years; and
SAM.govSAM.gov(3) Include its UEI in each application it submits to the Federal agency.
(c) For the purposes of this policy, the applicant must meet the Federal agency's eligibility criteria and have the legal authority to apply for and receive the Federal award. For example, if a consortium applies for a Federal award to be made to the consortium as the recipient, the consortium must have a UEI. If a consortium is eligible to receive funding under a Federal agency program, but the agency's policy is to make the Federal award to a lead entity for the consortium, the UEI of the lead applicant must be used.




25.205SECTION1§ 25.205   Effect of noncompliance with a requirement to obtain a UEI or register in .SAM.gov0714(a) Unless an entity is exempt under § 25.110, a Federal agency may not issue a Federal award or amend an existing Federal award to provide additional Federal funds if the entity is not in compliance with the requirements of this part.

25.220SECTION1§ 25.220   Use of award term.(a) A Federal agency must include the award term in Appendix A in all Federal financial assistance agreements (see § 25.400) to accomplish the purpose of § 25.100.
(b) A Federal agency may use different letters and numbers than those in Appendix A to designate the paragraphs of the award term.


CSUBPARTSubpart C—Recipient Requirements of Subrecipients25.300SECTION1§ 25.300   Requirement for recipients to ensure subrecipients have a unique entity identifier.(a) A recipient may not make a subaward to a subrecipient that has not obtained a UEI and provided it to the recipient.

If use of domestic iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods would increase the cost of the overall project by more than 25 percent, then the award official shall determine that the cost of the domestic iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods is unreasonable.


176.110SECTION1§ 176.110   Evaluating proposals of foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods.(a) If the award official receives a request for an exception based on the cost of certain domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods being unreasonable, in accordance with § 176.80, then the award official shall apply evaluation factors to the proposal to use such foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods as follows:
(1) Use an evaluation factor of 25 percent, applied to the total estimated cost of the project, if the foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods are to be used in the project based on an exception for unreasonable cost requested by the applicant.
(2) Total evaluated cost = project cost estimate + (.25 × project cost estimate, if paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies).
(b) Applicants or recipients also may submit alternate proposals based on use of equivalent domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods to avoid possible denial of Recovery Act funding for the proposal if the Federal Government determines that an exception permitting use of the foreign item(s) does not apply.
(c) If the award official makes an award to an applicant that proposed foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods not listed in the applicable notice in the request for applications or proposals, then the award official must add the excepted materials to the list in the award term.


176.120SECTION1§ 176.120   Determinations on late requests.(a) If a recipient requests a determination regarding the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act after obligating Recovery Act funds for a project for construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair (late request), the recipient must explain why it could not request the determination before making the obligation or why the need for such determination otherwise was not reasonably foreseeable. If the award official concludes that the recipient should have made the request before making the obligation, the award official may deny the request.
(b) The award official must base evaluation of any late request for a determination regarding the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act on information required by § 176.150(c) and (d) or § 176.170(c) and (d) and/or other readily available information.
(c) If a determination, under § 176.80 is made after Recovery Act funds were obligated for a project for construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act applies, the award official must amend the award to allow use of the foreign iron, steel, and/or relevant manufactured goods. When the basis of the exception is nonavailability or public interest, the amended award shall reflect adjustment of the award amount, redistribution of budgeted funds, and/or other appropriate actions taken to cover costs associated with acquiring or using the foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods. When the basis for the exception is the unreasonable cost of domestic iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods the award official shall adjust the award amount or the budget, as appropriate, by at least the differential established in § 176.110(a).


176.130SECTION1§ 176.130   Noncompliance.The award official must—
(a) Review allegations of violations of section 1605 of the Recovery Act;
(b) Unless fraud is suspected, notify the recipient of the apparent unauthorized use of foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods and request a reply, to include proposed corrective action; and
(c) If the review reveals that a recipient or subrecipient has used foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods without authorization, take appropriate action, including one or more of the following:
(1) Process a determination concerning the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act in accordance with § 176.120.
(2) Consider requiring the removal and replacement of the unauthorized foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods.
(3) If removal and replacement of foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods used in a public building or a public work would be impracticable, cause undue delay, or otherwise be detrimental to the interests of the Federal Government, the award official may determine in writing that the foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods need not be removed and replaced. A determination to retain foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods does not constitute a determination that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act applies, and this should be stated in the determination. Further, a determination to retain foreign iron, steel, and/or manufactured goods does not affect the Federal Government's right to reduce the amount of the award by the cost of the steel, iron, or manufactured goods that are used in the project or to take enforcement or termination action in accordance with the agency's grants management regulations.
(4) If the noncompliance is sufficiently serious, consider exercising appropriate remedies, such as withholding cash payments pending correction of the deficiency, suspending or terminating the award, and withholding further awards for the project. Also consider preparing and forwarding a report to the agency suspending or debarring official in accordance with the agency's debarment rule implementing 2 CFR part 180. If the noncompliance appears to be fraudulent, refer the matter to other appropriate agency officials, such as the officer responsible for criminal investigation.

NCSUBPARTSubpart C—Wage Rate Requirements Under Section 1606 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009176.180SECTION1§ 176.180   Procedure.The award official shall insert the standard award term in this subpart in all awards funded in whole or in part with Recovery Act funds.


176.190SECTION1§ 176.190   Award term—Wage rate requirements under Section 1606 of the Recovery Act.When issuing announcements or requesting applications for Recovery Act programs or activities that may involve construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair the agency shall use the award term described in the following paragraphs:
(a) Section 1606 of the Recovery Act requires that all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors and subcontractors on projects funded directly by or assisted in whole or in part by and through the Federal Government pursuant to the Recovery Act shall be paid wages at rates not less than those prevailing on projects of a character similar in the locality as determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40, United States Code.
Pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 14 and the Copeland Act, 40 U.S.C. 3145, the Department of Labor has issued regulations at 29 CFR parts 1, 3, and 5 to implement the Davis-Bacon and related Acts. Regulations in 29 CFR 5.5 instruct agencies concerning application of the standard Davis-Bacon contract clauses set forth in that section. Federal agencies providing grants, cooperative agreements, and loans under the Recovery Act shall ensure that the standard Davis-Bacon contract clauses found in 29 CFR 5.5(a) are incorporated in any resultant covered contracts that are in excess of $2,000 for construction, alteration or repair (including painting and decorating).
(b) For additional guidance on the wage rate requirements of section 1606, contact your awarding agency. Recipients of grants, cooperative agreements and loans should direct their initial inquiries concerning the application of Davis-Bacon requirements to a particular federally assisted project to the Federal agency funding the project. The Secretary of Labor retains final coverage authority under Reorganization Plan Number 14.


DSUBPARTSubpart D—Single Audit Information for Recipients of Recovery Act Funds176.200SECTION1§ 176.200   Procedure.The award official shall insert the standard award term in this subpart in all awards funded in whole or in part with Recovery Act funds.


176.210SECTION1§ 176.210   Award term—Recovery Act transactions listed in Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards and Recipient Responsibilities for Informing Subrecipients.The award term described in this section shall be used by agencies to clarify recipient responsibilities regarding tracking and documenting Recovery Act expenditures:
(a) To maximize the transparency and accountability of funds authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5) (Recovery Act) as required by Congress and in accordance with 2 CFR 215.21 “Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements” and OMB Circular A-102 Common Rules provisions, recipients agree to maintain records that identify adequately the source and application of Recovery Act funds. OMB Circular A-102 is available at 
http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a102/a102.html.(b) For recipients covered by the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 and OMB Circular A-133, “Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations,” recipients agree to separately identify the expenditures for Federal awards under the Recovery Act on the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA) and the Data Collection Form (SF-SAC) required by OMB Circular A-133. OMB Circular A-133 is available at  This shall be accomplished by identifying expenditures for Federal awards made under the Recovery Act separately on the SEFA, and as separate rows under Item 9 of Part III on the SF-SAC by CFDA number, and inclusion of the prefix “ARRA-” in identifying the name of the Federal program on the SEFA and as the first characters in Item 9d of Part III on the SF-SAC.
http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a133/a133.html.(c) Recipients agree to separately identify to each subrecipient, and document at the time of subaward and at the time of disbursement of funds, the Federal award number, CFDA number, and amount of Recovery Act funds. When a recipient awards Recovery Act funds for an existing program, the information furnished to subrecipients shall distinguish the subawards of incremental Recovery Act funds from regular subawards under the existing program.
(d) Recipients agree to require their subrecipients to include on their SEFA information to specifically identify Recovery Act funding similar to the requirements for the recipient SEFA described above. This information is needed to allow the recipient to properly monitor subrecipient expenditure of ARRA funds as well as oversight by the Federal awarding agencies, Offices of Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office.

(b) Subparts A through I contain uniform government-wide standards that Federal agencies are to use to specify:
(1) The types of transactions that are covered by the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system;
(2) The effects of an exclusion under that nonprocurement system, including reciprocal effects with the government-wide debarment and suspension system for procurement;
(3) The criteria and minimum due process to be used in nonprocurement debarment and suspension actions; and
(4) Related policies and procedures to ensure the effectiveness of those actions.




180.15SECTION1§ 180.15   To whom does the guidance apply?This part provides guidance to Federal agencies. Publication of this guidance in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) does not change its nature—it is guidance and not regulation. Federal agencies' implementation of this guidance governs the rights and responsibilities of other persons affected by the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system.




180.20SECTION1§ 180.20   What must a Federal agency do to implement these guidelines?As Section 3 of Executive Order 12549 requires, each Federal agency with nonprocurement programs and activities covered by subparts A through I of the guidance must issue regulations consistent with those subparts.




180.25SECTION1§ 180.25   What must a Federal agency address in its implementation of the guidance?Each Federal agency's implementing regulation:
(a) Must establish policies and procedures for that Federal agency's nonprocurement debarment and suspension programs and activities consistent with this guidance. When adopted by a Federal agency, the provisions of the guidance have a regulatory effect on that Federal agency's programs and activities.
(b) Must address some matters for which these guidelines give each Federal agency some discretion. Specifically, the regulation must:
(1) Identify either the Federal agency head or the title of the designated official who is authorized to grant exceptions under § 180.135 to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction.
(2) State whether the Federal agency includes as covered transactions an additional tier of contracts awarded under covered nonprocurement transactions, as permitted under § 180.220(c).
(3) Identify the method(s) a Federal agency official may use when entering into a covered transaction with a primary tier participant to communicate to the participant the requirements described in § 180.435. Examples of methods are an award term that requires compliance as a condition of the award, an assurance of compliance obtained at the time of application, or a certification.
(4) State whether the Federal agency specifies a particular method that participants must use to communicate compliance requirements to lower tier participants, as described in § 180.330(a). If there is a specified method, the regulation must require Federal agency officials to communicate that requirement when entering into covered transactions with primary tier participants.
(c) May also, at the Federal agency's option:
(1) Identify any specific types of transactions the Federal agency includes as “nonprocurement transactions” in addition to the examples provided in § 180.970.
(2) Identify any types of nonprocurement transactions that the Federal agency exempts from coverage under these guidelines, as authorized under § 180.215(g)(2).
(3) Identify specific examples of types of individuals who would be “principals” under the Federal agency's nonprocurement programs and transactions, in addition to the types of individuals described in § 180.995.
(4) Specify the Federal agency's procedures, if any, by which a respondent may appeal a suspension or debarment decision.
(5) Identify by title the officials designated by the Federal agency head as debarring officials under § 180.930 or suspending officials under § 180.1010.
(6) Include a subpart covering disqualifications, as authorized in § 180.45.
(7) Include any provisions authorized by OMB.




180.30SECTION1§ 180.30   Where does a Federal agency implement these guidelines?Each Federal agency that participates in the government-wide nonprocurement debarment and suspension system must issue a regulation implementing these guidelines within its chapter in subtitle B of this title.




180.40SECTION1§ 180.40   How are these guidelines maintained?The Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension, established by section 4 of Executive Order 12549, recommends to the OMB any needed revisions to the guidelines in this part. The OMB publishes proposed changes to the guidelines in the  for public comment, considers comments with the help of the Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension, and issues the final guidelines.




Federal Register04180.45SECTION1§ 180.45   Do these guidelines cover persons who are disqualified, as well as those who are excluded from nonprocurement transactions?A Federal agency may add a subpart covering disqualifications to its regulation implementing these guidelines, but the guidelines in subparts A through I:
(a) Address disqualified persons only to:
(1) Provide for their inclusion in the System for Award Management (SAM.gov) Exclusions; and
(2) State the responsibilities of Federal agencies and participants to check for disqualified persons before entering into covered transactions.
(b) Do not specify the:
(1) Transactions for which a disqualified person is ineligible. Those transactions vary on a case-by-case basis because they depend on the language of the specific statute, Executive order, or regulation that caused the disqualification;
(2) Entities to which a disqualification applies; or
(3) Process that a Federal agency uses to disqualify a person. Unlike exclusion under subparts A through I of this part, disqualification is frequently not a discretionary action that a Federal agency takes and may include special procedures.


ASUBPARTSubpart A—General180.100SECTION1§ 180.100   How are subparts A through I organized?(a) Each subpart contains information related to a broad topic or specific audience with special responsibilities, as shown in table 1:

The section headings and text must be read together, as they are often in the form of questions and answers.
(b) Pronouns used within this part, such as “I” and “you,” change from subpart to subpart depending on the audience being addressed.
(c) The “Covered Transactions” diagram in the appendix to this part shows the levels or “tiers” at which a Federal agency may enforce an exclusion.




180.110SECTION1§ 180.110   Do terms in this part have special meanings?This part uses terms throughout the text that have special meanings. Those terms are defined in subpart I. For example, three important terms are:
(a)  which refers only to discretionary actions taken by a suspending or debarring official under Executive Order 12549 and Executive Order 12689 or under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4);
Exclusion or excluded,(b)  which refers to prohibitions under specific statutes, executive orders (other than Executive Order 12549 and Executive Order 12689), or other authorities. Disqualifications frequently are not subject to the discretion of a Federal agency official, may have a different scope than exclusions, or have special conditions that apply to the disqualification; and
Disqualification or disqualified,(c)  which generally refers to a person who is either excluded or disqualified.




Ineligibility or ineligible,180.115SECTION1§ 180.115   What do subparts A through I of this part do?Subparts A through I provide for the reciprocal exclusion of persons who have been excluded under the Federal Acquisition Regulations and provide for the consolidated listing of all persons who are excluded, or disqualified by statute, executive order or other legal authority.




180.120SECTION1§ 180.120   Do subparts A through I of this part apply to me?Portions of subparts A through I (see table at § 180.100(b)) apply to you if you are a:
(a) Person who has been, is, or may reasonably be expected to be, a participant or principal in a covered transaction;
(b) Respondent (a person against whom a Federal agency has initiated a debarment for suspension action);
(c) Federal agency debarring or suspending official; or
(d) Federal agency official who is authorized to enter into covered transactions with non-Federal parties.




180.125SECTION1§ 180.125   What is the purpose of the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system?(a) To protect the public interest, the Federal Government ensures the integrity of Federal programs by conducting business only with responsible persons.
(b) A Federal agency uses the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system to exclude persons who are not presently responsible from Federal programs.
(c) An exclusion is a serious action that a Federal agency may take only to protect the public interest. A Federal agency may not exclude a person or commodity for the purposes of punishment.




180.130SECTION1§ 180.130   How does an exclusion restrict a person's involvement in covered transactions?With the exceptions stated in §§ 180.135, 315, and 420, a person who is excluded by any Federal agency may not:
(a) Be a participant in a Federal agency transaction that is a covered transaction; or
(b) Act as a principal of a person participating in one of those covered transactions.




180.135SECTION1§ 180.135   May a Federal agency grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?(a) A Federal agency head or designee may grant an exception permitting an excluded person to participate in a particular covered transaction. If the Federal agency head or designee grants an exception, the exception must be in writing and state the reason(s) for deviating from the government-wide policy in Executive Order 12549.
(b) An exception granted by one Federal agency for an excluded person does not extend to the covered transactions of another Federal agency.




180.140SECTION1§ 180.140   Does an exclusion under the nonprocurement system affect a person's eligibility for Federal procurement contracts?When a Federal agency excludes a person under Executive Order 12549 or Executive Order 12689 on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible for Federal procurement transactions under the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Therefore, an exclusion under this part has a reciprocal effect on Federal procurement transactions.




180.145SECTION1§ 180.145   Does an exclusion under the Federal procurement system affect a person's eligibility to participate in nonprocurement transactions?When a Federal agency excludes a person under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible to participate in Federal agencies' nonprocurement covered transactions. Therefore, an exclusion under the FAR has a reciprocal effect on Federal nonprocurement transactions.




180.150SECTION1§ 180.150   Against whom may a Federal agency take an exclusion action?Given a cause that justifies an exclusion under this part, a Federal agency may exclude any person who has been, is, or may reasonably be expected to be a participant or principal in a covered transaction.




180.155SECTION1§ 180.155   How do I know if a person is excluded?Check the System for Award Management () Exclusions to determine whether a person is excluded. The General Services Administration (GSA) maintains  Exclusions and makes it available, as detailed in subpart E. When a Federal agency takes action to exclude a person under the nonprocurement or procurement debarment and suspension system, the agency enters the information about the excluded person into SAM.gov Exclusions.


SAM.govSAM.govBSUBPARTSubpart B—Covered Transactions180.200SECTION1§ 180.200   What is a covered transaction?A covered transaction is a nonprocurement or procurement transaction subject to this part's prohibitions. It may be a transaction at:
(a) The primary tier, between a Federal agency and a person (see Appendix to this part); or
(b) A lower tier between a participant in a covered transaction and another person.




180.205SECTION1§ 180.205   Why is it important if a particular transaction is a covered transaction?The importance of whether a transaction is a covered transaction depends upon who you are.
(a) As a participant in the transaction, you have the responsibilities laid out in subpart C of this part. Those include responsibilities to the person or Federal agency at the next higher tier from whom you received the transaction, if any. They also include responsibilities if you subsequently enter into other covered transactions with persons at the next lower tier.
(b) As a Federal official who enters into a primary tier transaction, you have the responsibilities laid out in subpart D of this part.
(c) As an excluded person, you may not be a participant or principal in the transaction unless:
(1) The person who entered into the transaction with you allows you to continue your involvement in a transaction that predates your exclusion, as permitted under § 180.310 or § 180.415; or
(2) A Federal agency official obtains an exception from the agency head or designee to allow you to be involved in the transaction, as permitted under § 180.135.




180.210SECTION1§ 180.210   Which nonprocurement transactions are covered transactions?All nonprocurement transactions, as defined in § 180.970, are covered transactions unless listed in the exemptions under § 180.215.




180.215SECTION1§ 180.215   Which nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions?The following types of nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions:
(a) A direct award to:
(1) A foreign government or foreign governmental entity;
(2) A public international organization;
(3) An entity owned (in whole or in part) or controlled by a foreign government; or
(4) Any other entity consisting wholly or partially of one or more foreign governments or foreign governmental entities.
(b) A benefit to an individual as a personal entitlement without regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received in an individual's business capacity are not excepted). For example, when a person receives social security benefits under the Supplemental Security Income provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1301  those benefits are not covered transactions and, therefore, are not affected if the person is excluded.
et seq.,(c) Federal employment.
(d) A transaction that a Federal agency needs to respond to a national or agency recognized emergency or disaster.
(e) A permit, license, certificate, or similar instrument issued as a means to regulate public health, safety, or the environment, unless a Federal agency specifically designates it to be a covered transaction.
(f) An incidental benefit that results from ordinary governmental operations.
(g) Any other transaction if:
(1) The application of an exclusion to the transaction is prohibited by law; or
(2) A Federal agency's regulation exempts it from coverage under this part.
(h) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, covered transactions must include non-procurement and procurement transactions involving entities engaged in activity that contributed to or is a significant factor in a country's non-compliance with its obligations under arms control, nonproliferation or disarmament agreements, or commitments with the United States. Federal agencies and primary tier non-procurement recipients must not award, renew, or extend a non-procurement transaction or procurement transaction, regardless of amount or tier, with any entity listed in SAM.gov Exclusions on the basis of involvement in activities that violate arms control, nonproliferation or disarmament agreements, or commitments with the United States (see section 1290 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017). The head of a Federal agency may grant an exception to this requirement under 2 CFR 180.135 and with the concurrence of the OMB Director.




180.220SECTION1§ 180.220   Are any procurement contracts included as covered transactions?(a) Covered transactions under this part:
(1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a Federal agency; but
(2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded under nonprocurement covered transactions.
(b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered transaction if any of the following applies:
(1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement transaction covered under § 180.210, and the contract amount is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.
(2) The contract requires the consent of an official of a Federal agency. In that case, the contract is always a covered transaction regardless of the amount or who awarded it. For example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the Appendix to this part.
(3) The contract is for Federally required audit services.
(c) A subcontract also is a covered transaction if:
(1) It is awarded by a participant in a procurement transaction under a nonprocurement transaction of a Federal agency that extends the coverage of paragraph (b)(1) of this section to additional tiers of contracts (see the diagram in the Appendix to this part showing that optional lower tier coverage); and
(2) The value of the subcontract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.




180.225SECTION1§ 180.225   How do I know if a transaction in which I may participate is a covered transaction?As a participant in a transaction, you will know that it is a covered transaction because of the Federal agency regulations governing the transaction. The appropriate Federal agency official or participant at the next higher tier who enters into the transaction with you will tell you that you must comply with applicable portions of this part.


CSUBPARTSubpart C—Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions Doing Business With Other Persons180.300SECTION1§ 180.300   What must I do before I enter into a covered transaction with another person at the next lower tier?When you enter into a covered transaction with another person at the next lower tier, you must verify that the person with whom you intend to do business is not excluded or disqualified. You do this by:
(a) Checking  Exclusions; or
SAM.gov(b) Collecting a certification from that person; or
(c) Adding a clause or condition to the covered transaction with that person.




180.305SECTION1§ 180.305   May I enter into a covered transaction with an excluded or disqualified person?(a) As a participant, you may not enter into a covered transaction with an excluded person unless the Federal agency responsible for the transaction grants an exception under § 180.135.
(b) You may not enter into any transaction with a person who is disqualified from that transaction unless you have obtained an exception under the disqualifying statute, Executive Order, or regulation.




180.310SECTION1§ 180.310   What must I do if a Federal agency excludes a person with whom I am already doing business in a covered transaction?(a) As a participant, you may continue covered transactions with an excluded person if the transactions were in existence when the Federal agency excluded the person. However, you are not required to continue the transactions, and you may consider termination. You should decide whether to terminate and the type of termination action, if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.
(b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any excluded person unless the Federal agency responsible for the transaction grants an exception under § 180.135.




180.315SECTION1§ 180.315   May I use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction?(a) As a participant, you may continue to use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction if you were using that person's services in the transaction before the person was excluded. However, you are not required to continue using that person's services as a principal. You should decide whether to discontinue that person's services only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.
(b) You may not begin to use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction unless the Federal agency responsible for the transaction grants an exception under § 180.135.




180.320SECTION1§ 180.320   Must I verify that principals of my covered transactions are eligible to participate?(a) Yes. As a participant, you are responsible for determining whether your principals of your covered transactions are excluded or disqualified from participating in the transaction.
(b) You may decide the method and frequency by which you do so. You may, but are not required to check  Exclusions.




SAM.gov180.325SECTION1§ 180.325   What happens if I do business with an excluded person in a covered transaction?As a participant, if you knowingly do business with an excluded person, the Federal agency responsible for your transaction may disallow costs, annul or terminate the transaction, issue a stop work order, debar or suspend you, or take other remedies as appropriate.




180.330SECTION1§ 180.330   What requirements must I pass down to persons at lower tiers with whom I intend to do business?Before entering into a covered transaction with a participant at the next lower tier, you must require that participant to:
(a) Comply with this subpart as a condition of participating in the transaction. You may do so using any method(s) unless the regulation of the Federal agency responsible for the transaction requires you to use specific methods.
(b) Pass the requirement to comply with this subpart to each person the participant enters into a covered transaction at the next lower tier.


ECFRe1a8b70dfdc38beSUBJGRPDisclosing Information—Primary Tier Participants180.335SECTION1§ 180.335   What information must I provide before entering into a covered transaction with a Federal agency?Before you enter into a covered transaction at the primary tier, you, as the participant, must notify the Federal agency office that is entering into the transaction with you if you know that you or any of the principals for that covered transaction:

180.340SECTION1§ 180.340   If I disclose unfavorable information required under § 180.335, will I be prevented from participating in the transaction?As a primary tier participant, disclosing unfavorable information about yourself or a principal under § 180.335 will not necessarily cause a Federal agency to deny your participation in the covered transaction. The Federal agency will consider the information when determining whether to enter into the covered transaction. The Federal agency will also consider any additional information or explanation you elect to submit with the disclosed information.




180.345SECTION1§ 180.345   What happens if I fail to disclose information required under § 180.335?If a Federal agency later determines that you failed to disclose information under § 180.335 that you knew at the time you entered into the covered transaction, the Federal agency may:
(a) Terminate the transaction for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the transaction; or
(b) Pursue any other available remedies, including suspension and debarment.




180.350SECTION1§ 180.350   What must I do if I learn of information required under § 180.335 after entering into a covered transaction with a Federal agency?At any time after you enter into a covered transaction, you must give immediate written notice to the Federal agency office with which you entered into the transaction if you learn either that:
(a) You failed to disclose information earlier, as required by § 180.335; or
(b) Due to changed circumstances, you or any of the principals for the transaction now meet any of the criteria in § 180.335.

(b) A transaction with a person who is disqualified from that transaction unless you obtain a waiver or exception under the statute, Executive Order, or regulation that is the basis for the person's disqualification.




180.425SECTION1§ 180.425   When do I check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified?As a Federal agency official, you must check to see if a person is excluded or disqualified before you:
(a) Enter into a primary tier covered transaction;

(a) For suspension actions, a Federal agency uses the procedures in this subpart and subpart G.
(b) For debarment actions, a Federal agency uses the procedures in this subpart and subpart H.




180.615SECTION1§ 180.615   How does a Federal agency notify a person of a suspension or debarment action?(a) The suspending or debarring official sends a written notice to the last known street address, facsimile number, or email address of:
(1) You or your identified counsel; or
(2) Your agent for service of process, or any of your partners, officers, directors, owners, or joint venturers.
(b) The notice is effective if sent to any of these persons.




180.620SECTION1§ 180.620   Do Federal agencies coordinate suspension and debarment actions?Yes, when more than one Federal agency has an interest in a suspension or debarment, the agencies may consider designating one Federal agency as the lead agency for making the decision. Agencies are encouraged to establish methods and procedures for coordinating their suspension and debarment actions.




180.625SECTION1§ 180.625   What is the scope of a suspension or debarment?If you are suspended or debarred, the suspension or debarment is effective as follows:

The organization's acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.
Conduct imputed from an individual to an organization.(b)  A Federal agency may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any organization to an individual, or from one individual to another individual, if the individual to whom the improper conduct is imputed either participated in, had knowledge of, or reason to know of the improper conduct.
Conduct imputed from an organization to an individual or between individuals.(c)  A Federal agency may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of one organization to another organization when the improper conduct occurred in connection with a partnership, joint venture, joint application, association, corporation, company, or similar arrangement or with the organization's knowledge, approval, or acquiescence, or when the organization to whom the improper conduct is imputed has the power to direct, manage, control or influence the activities of the organization responsible for the improper conduct.

(b) There exists adequate evidence to suspect any other cause for debarment listed under § 180.800(b) through (d); and
(c) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest.




180.705SECTION1§ 180.705   What does the suspending official consider in issuing a suspension?(a) In determining the adequacy of the evidence to support the suspension, the suspending official considers how much information is available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result.
(b) In making this determination, the suspending official may examine:
(1) The basic documents, including grants, cooperative agreements, loan authorizations, contracts, and other relevant documents;
(2) An indictment, criminal information, conviction, civil judgment, or other official findings by Federal, State, or local bodies that determine factual or legal matters constitutes adequate evidence for purposes of suspension actions; and
(3) Other indicators of adequate evidence that may include, but are not limited to, warrants and their accompanying affidavits.
(c) In deciding whether immediate action is needed to protect the public interest, the suspending official has wide discretion. For example, the suspending official may infer the necessity for immediate action to protect the public interest either from the nature of the circumstances giving rise to a cause for suspension or from potential business relationships or involvement with a program of the Federal Government.




180.710SECTION1§ 180.710   When does a suspension take effect?A suspension is effective when the suspending official signs the decision to suspend.

However, a suspension may not exceed 12 months if proceedings are not initiated.
(b) The suspending official may extend the 12-month limit under paragraph (a) of this section for an additional 6 months if an office of a U.S. Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Attorney, or other Federal, State, or local responsible prosecuting official requests an extension in writing.

The existence or nonexistence of any factor, such as one of those set forth in this section, is not necessarily determinative of your present responsibility. In making a debarment decision, the debarring official may consider the following factors:
(a) The actual or potential harm or impact that results or may result from the wrongdoing.
(b) The frequency of incidents or duration of the wrongdoing.
(c) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing. For example, if you have been found by another Federal agency or a State agency to have engaged in wrongdoing similar to that found in the debarment action, the existence of this fact may be used by the debarring official in determining that you have a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing.
(d) Whether you are or have been excluded or disqualified by an agency of the Federal Government or have not been allowed to participate in State or local contracts or assistance agreements on a basis of conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.
(e) Whether you have entered into an administrative agreement with a Federal agency or a State or local government that is not government-wide but is based on conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.
(f) Whether and to what extent you planned, initiated, or carried out the wrongdoing.
(g) Whether you have accepted responsibility for the wrongdoing and recognize the seriousness of the misconduct that led to the cause for debarment.
(h) Whether you have paid or agreed to pay all criminal, civil, and administrative liabilities for the improper activity, including any investigative or administrative costs incurred by the government, and have made or agreed to make full restitution.
(i) Whether you have cooperated fully with the government agencies during the investigation and any court or administrative action. In determining the extent of cooperation, the debarring official may consider when the cooperation began and whether you disclosed all pertinent information known to you.
(j) Whether the wrongdoing was pervasive within your organization.
(k) The kind of positions held by the individuals involved in the wrongdoing.
(l) Whether your organization took appropriate corrective action or implemented remedial or protective measures in the form of procedures, policies, and programs to effectively address the activity cited as a basis for the debarment.
(m) Whether your principals tolerated the offense.
(n) Whether you brought the activity cited as a basis for the debarment to the attention of the appropriate government agency in a timely manner.
(o) Whether you have fully investigated the circumstances surrounding the cause for debarment and, if so, made the result of the investigation available to the debarring official.
(p) Whether you had effective standards of conduct and internal control systems in place at the time the questioned conduct occurred.
(q) Whether you have taken appropriate disciplinary action against the individuals responsible for the activity which constitutes the cause for debarment.
(r) Whether you have had adequate time to eliminate the circumstances within your organization that led to the cause for the debarment.
(s) Whether your business, technical, or professional license(s) has been suspended, terminated, or revoked.
(t) Other factors that are appropriate to the circumstances of a particular case.




180.865SECTION1§ 180.865   How long may my debarment last?(a) If the debarring official decides to debar you, your period of debarment will be based on the seriousness of the cause(s) upon which your debarment is based. Generally, debarment should not exceed three years. However, if circumstances warrant, the debarring official may impose a longer period of debarment.
(b) In determining the period of debarment, the debarring official may consider the factors in § 180.860. If a suspension has preceded your debarment, the debarring official must consider the time you were suspended.
(c) If the debarment is for a violation of the provisions of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, your period of debarment may not exceed five years.




180.870SECTION1§ 180.870   When do I know if the debarring official debars me?(a) The debarring official must make a written decision whether to debar within 45 days of closing the official record. The official record closes upon the debarring official's receipt of final submissions, information, and findings of fact, if any. The debarring official may extend that period for good cause.
(b) The debarring official sends you written notice, pursuant to § 180.615, that the official decided either:
(1) Not to debar you; or
(2) To debar you. In this event, the notice:
(i) Refers to the Notice of Proposed Debarment;
(ii) Specifies the reasons for your debarment;
(iii) States the period of your debarment, including the effective dates; and
(iv) Advises you that your debarment is effective for covered transactions and contracts that are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (48 CFR chapter 1) throughout the executive branch of the Federal Government unless an agency head or an authorized designee grants an exception.




180.875SECTION1§ 180.875   May I ask the debarring official to reconsider a decision to debar me?Yes. As a debarred person, you may ask the debarring official to reconsider the debarment decision or to reduce the time period or scope of the debarment. However, you must submit your request in writing and support it with documentation.




180.880SECTION1§ 180.880   What factors may influence the debarring official during reconsideration?The debarring official may reduce or terminate your debarment based on:
(a) Newly discovered material evidence;
(b) A reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which your debarment was based;
(c) A bona fide change in ownership or management;
(d) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; or
(e) Other reasons the debarring official finds appropriate.




180.885SECTION1§ 180.885   May the debarring official extend a debarment?(a) Yes. The debarring official may extend a debarment for an additional period if that official determines that an extension is necessary to protect the public interest.
(b) However, the debarring official may not extend a debarment solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon which the initial debarment action was based.
(c) If the debarring official decides that a debarment for an additional period is necessary, the debarring official must follow the applicable procedures in this subpart, and subpart F, to extend the debarment.

It also applies the provisions of the Act to cooperative agreements and other financial assistance awards, as a matter of Federal Government policy.




182.10SECTION1§ 182.10   How is this part organized?This part is organized into two segments.
(a) Sections 182.5 through 182.40 contain general policy direction for Federal agencies' use of the uniform policies and procedures in subparts A through F.

(1) Types of awards that are covered by drug-free workplace requirements;
(2) Drug-free workplace requirements with which a recipient must comply;

(4) Consequences of a violation of drug-free workplace requirements.




182.15SECTION1§ 182.15   To whom does the guidance apply?This part provides guidance to Federal agencies. Publication of this guidance in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) does not change its nature—it is guidance and not regulation. Federal agencies' implementation of this guidance governs the rights and responsibilities of other persons affected by the drug-free workplace requirements.




182.20SECTION1§ 182.20   What must a Federal agency do to implement the guidance?To comply with the requirement in 41 U.S.C. 8106 for government-wide regulations, each Federal agency that awards grants or cooperative agreements or makes other financial assistance awards that are subject to the drug-free workplace requirements in subparts A through F of the guidance must issue a regulation consistent with those subparts.




182.25SECTION1§ 182.25   What must a Federal agency address in its implementation of the guidance?Each Federal agency's implementing regulation:
(a) Must establish drug-free workplace policies and procedures for that Federal agency's Federal awards consistent with this guidance. When adopted by a Federal agency, the provisions of the guidance have a regulatory effect on that Federal agency's awards.
(b) Must address some matters for which the guidance in this part gives the Federal agency discretion. Specifically, the regulation must:
(1) State whether the Federal agency:
(i) Has a central point to which a recipient may send the notification of a conviction that is required under § 182.225(a) or § 182.300(b); or
(ii) Requires the recipient to send the notification to the Federal agency awarding official or their designee for each Federal award.
(2) Either:
(i) State that the Federal agency head is the official authorized to determine under § 182.500 or § 182.505 that a recipient has violated the drug-free workplace requirements; or
(ii) Provide the title of the official designated to make that determination.
(c) May also, at the Federal agency's option, identify any specific types of financial assistance awards, in addition to grants and cooperative agreements, to which the Federal agency makes this guidance applicable.




182.30SECTION1§ 182.30   Where does a Federal agency implement the guidance?Each Federal agency that awards grants or cooperative agreements or makes other financial assistance awards that are subject to the drug-free workplace guidance in this part must issue a regulation implementing the guidance within its chapter in subtitle B of this title of the Code of Federal Regulations.




182.40SECTION1§ 182.40   How is the guidance maintained?The OMB publishes proposed changes to the guidance in the  for public comment, considers comments with the help of appropriate interagency working groups, and then issues any changes to the guidance in final form.


Federal Register04ASUBPARTSubpart A—Purpose and Coverage182.100SECTION1§ 182.100   How is this part written?(a) This part uses a “plain language” format to make it easier for the general public and business community to use and understand. The section headings and text must be read together, as they are often in the form of questions and answers.
(b) Pronouns used within this part, such as “I” and “you,” change from subpart to subpart depending on the audience being addressed.




182.105SECTION1§ 182.105   Do terms in this part have special meanings?This part uses terms that have special meanings. Those terms are defined in subpart F.




182.110SECTION1§ 182.110   What do subparts A through F of this part do?Subparts A through F specify standard policies and procedures to carry out the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 for financial assistance awards.




182.115SECTION1§ 182.115   Does this part apply to me?(a) Portions of this part apply to you if you are either:
(1) A recipient of a Federal assistance award (see definitions of award and recipient in §§ 182.605 and 182.660, respectively); or
(2) A Federal agency awarding official.

182.125SECTION1§ 182.125   Does this part affect the Federal contracts that I receive?This part will affect future contract awards indirectly if you are debarred or suspended for a violation of the requirements of this part, as described in § 182.510(c). However, this part does not apply directly to procurement contracts. The portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 that applies to Federal procurement contracts is carried out through the Federal Acquisition Regulation in Chapter 1 of Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (the drug-free workplace coverage currently is in 48 CFR part 23, subpart 23.5).

(1) To the Federal agency awarding official that is making the Federal award, either at the time of application or upon award; or

184.1SECTION1§ 184.1   Purpose and policy.(a)  This part provides guidance to Federal agencies on the implementation of the Buy America Preference applicable to Federal financial assistance set forth in part I of subtitle A, Buy America Sourcing Preferences, of the Build America, Buy America Act included in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Pub. L. 117-58) at division G, title IX, subtitle A, part I, sections 70911 through 70917.
Purpose.(b)  The head of each Federal agency must ensure that none of the funds made available for a Federal award for an infrastructure project may be obligated unless all of the iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials incorporated into the project are produced in the United States.  section 70914(a) of the Build America Buy America Act.




Policy.See184.2SECTION1§ 184.2   Applicability, effective date, and severability.(a)  This part does not apply to a Buy America Preference meeting or exceeding the requirements of section 70914 of the Build America, Buy America Act applied by a Federal agency to Federal awards for infrastructure projects before November 15, 2021.
Non-applicability of this part to existing Buy America Preferences.(b)  The effective date of this part is October 23, 2023. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, this part applies to Federal awards obligated on or after its effective date. Awards obligated on or after May 14, 2022, the effective date of the Build America, Buy America Act, and before the effective date of this part, are instead subject to OMB Memorandum M-22-11.
Effective date of this part.(c)  If an infrastructure project that has previously received a Federal award obligated on or after May 14, 2022, but before the effective date of this part receives an additional Federal award obligated within one year of the effective date of this part, the additional Federal award is subject to OMB Memorandum M-22-11. However, if significant design or planning changes are made to the infrastructure project, the Federal agency may apply this part to the additional Federal award. Federal awards for an infrastructure project obligated after one year from the effective date of this part are subject to this part, regardless of whether this part applied to previous awards for the project.
Modified effective date of this part for certain infrastructure projects.(d)  The provisions of this part are separate and severable from one another. OMB intends that if a provision of this part is held to be invalid or unenforceable as applied to a particular person or circumstance, the provision should be construed so as to continue to give the maximum effect permitted by law as applied to other persons not similarly situated or to dissimilar circumstances. If any provision is determined to be wholly invalid and unenforceable, it should be severed from the remaining provisions of this part, which should remain in effect.




Severability.184.3SECTION1§ 184.3   Definitions.Acronyms used in this part have the same meaning as provided in 2 CFR 200.0. Terms not defined in this part have the same meaning as provided in 2 CFR 200.1, except for the terms “equipment,” “expenditures,” and “supplies,” which are not specifically defined for this part.

N184.4SECTION1§ 184.4   Applying the Buy America Preference to a Federal award.(a)  The Buy America Preference applies to Federal awards where funds are appropriated or otherwise made available for infrastructure projects in the United States, regardless of whether infrastructure is the primary purpose of the Federal award.
Applicability of Buy America Preference to infrastructure projects.(b)  All Federal awards with infrastructure projects must include the Buy America Preference in the terms and conditions. The Buy America Preference must be included in all subawards, contracts, and purchase orders for the work performed, or products supplied under the Federal award. The terms and conditions of a Federal award flow down to subawards to subrecipients unless a particular section of the terms and conditions of the Federal award specifically indicate otherwise.
Including the Buy America Preference in Federal awards.(c)  Infrastructure encompasses public infrastructure projects in the United States, which includes, at a minimum, the structures, facilities, and equipment for roads, highways, and bridges; public transportation; dams, ports, harbors, and other maritime facilities; intercity passenger and freight railroads; freight and intermodal facilities; airports; water systems, including drinking water and wastewater systems; electrical transmission facilities and systems; utilities; broadband infrastructure; and buildings and real property; and structures, facilities, and equipment that generate, transport, and distribute energy including electric vehicle (EV) charging.
Infrastructure in general.(d)  The Federal agency should interpret the term “infrastructure” broadly and consider the description provided in paragraph (c) of this section as illustrative and not exhaustive. When determining if a particular project of a type not listed in the description in paragraph (c) constitutes “infrastructure,” the Federal agency should consider whether the project will serve a public function, including whether the project is publicly owned and operated, privately operated on behalf of the public, or is a place of public accommodation, as opposed to a project that is privately owned and not open to the public.
Interpretation of infrastructure.(e)  (1) An article, material, or supply should only be classified into one of the following categories:
Categorization of articles, materials, and supplies.(i) Iron or steel products;
(ii) Manufactured products;
(iii) Construction materials; or
(iv) Section 70917(c) materials.
(2) An article, material, or supply should not be considered to fall into multiple categories. In some cases, an article, material, or supply may not fall under any of the categories listed in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The classification of an article, material, or supply as falling into one of the categories listed in paragraph (e)(1) must be made based on its status at the time it is brought to the work site for incorporation into an infrastructure project. In general, the work site is the location of the infrastructure project at which the iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials will be incorporated.
(f)  An article, material, or supply incorporated into an infrastructure project must meet the Buy America Preference for only the single category in which it is classified.




Application of the Buy America Preference by category.184.5SECTION1§ 184.5   Determining the cost of components for manufactured products.In determining whether the cost of components for manufactured products is greater than 55 percent of the total cost of all components, use the following instructions:
(a) For components purchased by the manufacturer, the acquisition cost, including transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the manufactured product (whether or not such costs are paid to a domestic firm), and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued); or
(b) For components manufactured by the manufacturer, all costs associated with the manufacture of the component, including transportation costs as described in paragraph (a) of this section, plus allocable overhead costs, but excluding profit. Cost of components does not include any costs associated with the manufacture of the manufactured product.




184.6SECTION1§ 184.6   Construction material standards.(a) The Buy America Preference applies to the following construction materials incorporated into infrastructure projects. Each construction material is followed by a standard for the material to be considered “produced in the United States.”
(1)  All manufacturing processes, from initial smelting or melting through final shaping, coating, and assembly, occurred in the United States.
Non-ferrous metals.(2)  All manufacturing processes, from initial combination of constituent plastic or polymer-based inputs, or, where applicable, constituent composite materials, until the item is in its final form, occurred in the United States.
Plastic and polymer-based products.(3)  All manufacturing processes, from initial batching and melting of raw materials through annealing, cooling, and cutting, occurred in the United States.
Glass.(4)  All manufacturing processes, from the initial ribboning (if applicable), through buffering, fiber stranding and jacketing, occurred in the United States. All manufacturing processes also include the standards for glass and optical fiber, but not for non-ferrous metals, plastic and polymer-based products, or any others.
Fiber optic cable (including drop cable).(5)  All manufacturing processes, from the initial preform fabrication stage through the completion of the draw, occurred in the United States.
Optical fiber.(6)  All manufacturing processes, from initial debarking through treatment and planing, occurred in the United States.
Lumber.(7)  All manufacturing processes, from initial blending of mined or synthetic gypsum plaster and additives through cutting and drying of sandwiched panels, occurred in the United States.
Drywall.(8)  All manufacturing processes from the initial combination of constituent materials until the wood product is in its final form, occurred in the United States.
Engineered wood.(b) Except as specifically provided, only a single standard under paragraph (a) of this section should be applied to a single construction material.




184.7SECTION1§ 184.7   Federal agency's issuance of a Buy America Preference waiver.(a)  A Federal agency may waive the application of the Buy America Preference in any case in which it finds that:
Justification of waivers.(1) Applying the Buy America Preference would be inconsistent with the public interest (a “public interest waiver”);
(2) Types of iron, steel, manufactured products, or construction materials are not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities or of a satisfactory quality (a “nonavailability waiver”); or
(3) The inclusion of iron, steel, manufactured products, or construction materials produced in the United States will increase the cost of the overall infrastructure project by more than 25 percent (an “unreasonable cost waiver”).
(b)  Recipients may request waivers from a Federal agency if the recipient reasonably believes a waiver is justified under paragraph (a) of this section. A request from a recipient to waive the application of the Buy America Preference must be provided to the Federal agency in writing. Federal agencies must provide waiver request submission instructions and guidance on the format, contents, and supporting materials required for waiver requests from recipients.
Requesting a waiver.(c)  Before issuing a proposed waiver, the Federal agency must prepare a detailed written explanation for the proposed determination to issue the waiver based on a justification listed under paragraph (a) of this section, including for waivers requested by a recipient.

For example, acquisition cost for equipment means the net invoice price of the equipment, including the cost of any modifications, attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make it usable for the purpose for which it is acquired. Acquisition costs for software include those development costs capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

Acquisition cost means a payment that a Federal agency or pass-through entity makes by any appropriate payment mechanism and payment method before the recipient or subrecipient disburses the funds for program purposes.
Advance payment means the process of assigning a cost, or a group of costs, to one or more cost objective(s), in reasonable proportion to the benefit provided or other equitable relationship.

Office of Management and Budget (OMB) means the Federal agency that provides the predominant amount of funding directly (direct funding) (as listed on the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards, see § 200.510(b)) to a recipient or subrecipient unless OMB designates a specific cognizant agency for audit. When the direct funding represents less than 25 percent of the total Federal expenditures (as direct and sub-awards) by the recipient or subrecipient, then the Federal agency with the predominant amount of total funding is the designated oversight agency for audit. When there is no direct funding, the Federal agency that is the predominant source of pass-through funding must assume the oversight responsibilities. The duties of the oversight agency for audit and the process for any reassignments are described in § 200.513(b).
Oversight agency for audit generally means an individual participating in or attending program activities under a Federal award, such as trainings or conferences, but who is not responsible for implementation of the Federal award. Individuals committing effort to the development or delivery of program activities under a Federal award (such as consultants, project personnel, or staff members of a recipient or subrecipient) are not participants. Examples of participants may include community members participating in a community outreach program, members of the public whose perspectives or input are sought as part of a program, students, or conference attendees.
Participant means direct costs that support participants (see definition for  in § 200.1) and their involvement in a Federal award, such as stipends, subsistence allowances, travel allowances, registration fees, temporary dependent care, and per diem paid directly to or on behalf of participants.
Participant support costsParticipant means a recipient or subrecipient that provides a subaward to a subrecipient (including lower tier subrecipients) to carry out part of a Federal program. The authority of the pass-through entity under this part flows through the subaward agreement between the pass-through entity and subrecipient.
Pass-through entity means a measurable target level of performance expressed as a tangible, measurable objective, against which actual achievement can be compared, including a goal expressed as a quantitative standard, value, or rate. In some instances (for example, discretionary research awards), this may be limited to the requirement to submit technical performance reports (to be evaluated in accordance with agency policy).
Performance goal means the time interval between the start and end date of a Federal award, which may include one or more budget periods. Identification of the period of performance in the Federal award consistent with § 200.211(b)(5) does not commit the Federal agency to fund the award beyond the currently approved budget period.
Period of performance means property other than real property. It may be tangible or intangible.
Personal property means information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual. Some PII is available in public sources such as telephone books, websites, and university listings. The definition of PII is not attached to any single category of information or technology. Instead, it requires a case-by-case assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified. Non-PII can become PII whenever additional information is made publicly available, in any medium and from any source, that could be used to identify an individual when combined with other available information.
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) means the written approval obtained in advance by an authorized official of a Federal agency or pass-through entity of certain costs or programmatic decisions.
Prior approval means gross income earned by the recipient or subrecipient that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the Federal award during the period of performance except as provided in § 200.307(c). Program income includes but is not limited to income from fees for services performed, the use or rental of real or personal property acquired under Federal awards, the sale of commodities or items fabricated under a Federal award, license fees, and royalties on patents and copyrights, and principal and interest on loans made with Federal award funds. Interest earned on advances of Federal funds is not program income. Except as otherwise provided in Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award, program income does not include rebates, credits, discounts, and interest earned on any of them. See § 200.407. See also 35 U.S.C. 200-212 “Disposition of Rights in Educational Awards,” which applies to inventions made under Federal awards.
Program income means total allowable costs incurred under a Federal award and all cost sharing, including third-party contributions.
Project cost means real property or personal property. See this section's definitions of  and 
Propertyreal propertypersonal property. means PII (see definition in this section), except for PII that must be disclosed by law. Examples of PII include, but are not limited to, social security number; passport number; credit card numbers; clearances, bank numbers; biometrics; date and place of birth; mother's maiden name; criminal, medical and financial records; and educational transcripts.
Protected Personally Identifiable Information (Protected PII) has the meaning given in paragraphs (1) through (3).
Questioned cost(1)  means an amount, expended or received from a Federal award, that in the auditor's judgment:
Questioned cost(i) Is noncompliant or suspected noncompliant with Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award;
(ii) At the time of the audit, lacked adequate documentation to support compliance; or
(iii) Appeared unreasonable and did not reflect the actions a prudent person would take in the circumstances.
(2) The questioned cost amount under (1)(ii) is calculated as if the portion of a transaction that lacked adequate documentation were confirmed noncompliant.
(3) There is no questioned cost solely because of:
(i) Deficiencies in internal control; or
(ii) Noncompliance with the reporting type of compliance requirement (described in the compliance supplement) if this noncompliance does not affect the amount expended or received from the Federal award.
(4)  means a questioned cost specifically identified by the auditor. Known questioned costs are a subset of likely questioned costs.
Known questioned cost(5)  means the auditor's best estimate of total questioned costs, not just the known questioned costs. Likely questioned costs are developed by extrapolating from audit evidence obtained, for example, by projecting known questioned costs identified in an audit sample to the entire population from which the sample was drawn. In evaluating the effect of questioned costs on the opinion on compliance, the auditor considers the likely questioned costs, not just the known questioned costs.
Likely questioned cost(6) Questioned costs are not improper payments until reviewed and confirmed to be improper payments as defined in OMB Circular A-123 Appendix C.
 means land, including land improvements, structures, and appurtenances thereto, and legal interests in land, including fee interest, licenses, rights of way, and easements. Real property excludes moveable machinery and equipment.
Real property means an entity that receives a Federal award directly from a Federal agency to carry out an activity under a Federal program. The term recipient does not include subrecipients or individuals that are participants or beneficiaries of the award.
Recipient means a Federal award for which the start date is contiguous with, or closely follows, the end of the expiring Federal award. The start date of a renewal award begins a new and distinct period of performance.
Renewal award means all basic and applied research activities and all development activities performed by a recipient or subrecipient. The term research also includes activities involving the training of individuals in research techniques where such activities use the same facilities as other research and development activities and where such activities are not included in the instruction function. “Research” is the systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied. “Development” is the systematic use of knowledge and understanding gained from research to produce useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including designing and developing prototypes and processes.
Research and Development (R&D) means the dollar amount below which a recipient or subrecipient may purchase property or services using small purchase methods (see § 200.320). Recipients and subrecipients adopt small purchase procedures to expedite the purchase of items at or below the simplified acquisition threshold. The simplified acquisition threshold set in the FAR at 48 CFR part 2, subpart 2.1 is used in this part as the simplified acquisition threshold for secondary procurement activities administered under Federal awards. The recipient or subrecipient is responsible for determining an appropriate simplified acquisition threshold, which is less than or equal to the dollar value established in the FAR, based on internal controls, an evaluation of risk, and its documented procurement procedures. Recipients and subrecipients should also determine if local government purchasing laws apply. This threshold must never exceed the dollar value established in the FAR.
Simplified acquisition threshold means equipment that is used only for research, medical, scientific, or other similar technical activities. Examples of special purpose equipment include microscopes, x-ray machines, surgical instruments, spectrometers, and associated software. See also the definitions of  and  in this section.
Special purpose equipmentequipmentgeneral purpose equipment means any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and any agency or instrumentality thereof exclusive of local governments.
State means Federal awards under those programs of general student assistance, such as those authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1070-1099d), which the U.S. Department of Education administers, and similar programs provided by other Federal agencies. It does not include Federal awards under programs that provide fellowships or similar Federal awards to students on a competitive basis or for specified studies or research.
Student Financial Aid (SFA) means an award provided by a pass-through entity to a subrecipient for the subrecipient to contribute to the goals and objectives of the project by carrying out part of a Federal award received by the pass-through entity. It does not include payments to a contractor, beneficiary, or participant. A subaward may be provided through any form of legal agreement consistent with criteria in with § 200.331, including an agreement the pass-through entity considers a contract.
Subaward means an entity that receives a subaward from a pass-through entity to carry out part of a Federal award. The term subrecipient does not include a beneficiary or participant. A subrecipient may also be a recipient of other Federal awards directly from a Federal agency.
Subrecipient means an entity in which more than 50 percent of the entity is owned or controlled directly by a parent corporation or through another subsidiary of a parent corporation.
Subsidiary means all tangible personal property other than those described in the  definition. A computing device is a supply if the acquisition cost is below the lesser of the capitalization level established by the recipient or subrecipient for financial statement purposes or $10,000, regardless of the length of its useful life. See this section's definitions of  and 
Supplyequipmentcomputing devicesequipment. means the cost of using communication technologies such as mobile phones, landlines, and the internet.
Telecommunications cost means the action a Federal agency or pass-through entity takes to discontinue a Federal award, in whole or in part, at any time before the planned end date of the period of performance. Termination does not include discontinuing a Federal award due to a lack of available funds.
Termination means the value of non-cash contributions ( property or services) that:
Third-party in-kind contributionsmeaning,(1) Benefit a project or program funded by a Federal award; and
(2) Are contributed by non-Federal third parties, without charge, to a recipient or subrecipient under a Federal award.
 means financial obligations incurred by the recipient or subrecipient but not paid (liquidated) for financial reports prepared on a cash basis. For reports prepared on an accrual basis, these are financial obligations incurred by the recipient or subrecipient but for which expenditures have not been recorded.
Unliquidated financial obligation means the amount of funds under a Federal award that the recipient or subrecipient has not obligated. The amount is computed by subtracting the cumulative amount of the recipient's or subrecipient's unliquidated financial obligations and expenditures under the Federal award from the cumulative amount of funds the Federal agency or pass-through entity authorized the recipient or subrecipient to obligate.
Unobligated balance means cost sharing specifically pledged voluntarily in the proposal's budget on the part of the recipient or subrecipient, which becomes a binding requirement of the Federal award. See § 200.306.


Voluntary committed cost sharing[89 FR 30136, Apr. 22, 2024, as amended at 89 FR 79732, Oct. 1, 2024]




NBSUBPARTSubpart B—General Provisions200.100SECTION1§ 200.100   Purpose.(a)  (1) This part establishes uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards. Federal agencies must not impose additional requirements except as allowed in §§ 200.102, 200.211, or unless specifically required by Federal statute, regulation, or Executive order.
Purpose.(2) This part provides Federal agencies with the policy for collecting and submitting information on all Federal financial assistance programs to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and communicating this information to the public. It also establishes Federal policies related to the delivery of this information to the public, including through the use of electronic media. It also sets forth how the General Services Administration (GSA), OMB, and Federal agencies implement the Federal Program Information Act (31 U.S.C. 6101-6106).
(b)  Subparts B through D set forth the uniform administrative requirements for Federal financial assistance. This includes establishing requirements for Federal agencies management of Federal financial assistance programs before a Federal award is made, and requirements that Federal agencies may impose on recipients and subrecipients throughout the lifecycle of a Federal award.
Administrative requirements.(c)  Subpart E establishes principles for determining allowable costs incurred by recipients and subrecipients under Federal awards. These principles are for the purpose of cost determination. They do not address the circumstances nor dictate the extent of Federal Government funding of a particular program or project.
Cost principles.(d)  Subpart F is issued pursuant to the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507). Subpart F sets forth the standards for achieving consistency and uniformity among Federal agencies for the audit of non-Federal entities expending Federal awards. Subpart F also provides the policies and procedures for Federal agencies or pass-through entities when using the results of these audits.

Subpart F only applies to non-Federal entities as defined in the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507). Federal agencies should apply the requirements to all recipients in a consistent and equitable manner to the extent permitted within applicable statutes, regulations, and policies.
(3) Throughout subparts A through F, the word “must” indicates a requirement. The words “should” or “may” indicate a recommended approach and permit discretion.
(4) Throughout subparts A through E, when the word “or” is used between the terms “recipient” and “subrecipient,” any requirements or recommendations in the relevant provisions of this part apply to the recipient, the subrecipient, or both, as applicable. The use of “or” between recipient and subrecipient does not mean that applicable requirements or recommendations only apply to one of these entities unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.
(b)  (1) Paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(5) of this section describe what portions of this part apply to specific types of Federal financial assistance. Paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section explain additional exceptions related to governing provisions and Federal program applicability. The terms and conditions of Federal awards (including this part) flow down to subawards to subrecipients unless a particular section of this part or the terms and conditions of the Federal award specifically indicate otherwise.

(c)  (1) Paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section describe what portions of this part apply to specific types of contracts and subcontracts awarded by a Federal agency to a non-Federal entity. See also paragraph (b)(5)(ii) on audit requirements. For both paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3):
Applicability to different types of contracts and subcontracts awarded by a Federal agency to a non-Federal entity under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).(i) In cases of conflict between the requirements of applicable portions of this part and the terms and conditions of the contract, the terms and conditions of the contract and the FAR prevail.
(ii) When the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) are applicable to the contract or subcontract, they also take precedence over this part.
(iii) In addition, costs that are identified as unallowable under 41 U.S.C. 4304(a) and as stated in the FAR (48 CFR part 31, subpart 31.2, and 48 CFR 31.603) are always unallowable.
(2)  When a non-Federal entity is awarded a cost-reimbursement contract under the FAR, only subpart D, §§ 200.331 through 200.333, and subparts E and F are applicable.
Cost-reimbursement contract under the FAR awarded to a non-Federal entity.(3)  When a non-Federal entity is awarded a fixed-price contract or subcontract under the FAR, only subpart A, subpart B (except for §§ 200.111, 200.112, and 200.113), subpart D (only at § 200.303 and §§ 200.331 through 200.333), and subpart E are applicable to the contract, except that subpart E is not applicable to fixed-price contracts and subcontracts that are not negotiated.
Fixed-price contract or subcontract under the FAR awarded to a non-Federal entity.(d)  With the exception of subpart F, which is required by the Single Audit Act, Federal statutes or regulations govern in any circumstances where they conflict with the provisions of this part. For agreements with Indian Tribes, this includes the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and Education and Assistance Act (ISDEAA), as amended (see 25 U.S.C. 5301-5423).

200.102SECTION1§ 200.102   Exceptions.(a)  Except for subpart F, OMB may allow exceptions from requirements of this part for classes of Federal awards, recipients, or subrecipients when the exceptions are not prohibited by statute. For example, Federal agencies may request exceptions in support of innovative program designs that apply a risk-based, data-driven framework to alleviate select compliance requirements and hold recipients accountable for good performance. See also § 200.206. Federal agencies may also request exceptions in emergency situations. When OMB allows an exception to requirements of this part, the Federal agency remains responsible for ensuring the exception is applied to Federal awards in a manner consistent with Federal statutes and regulations.
OMB class exceptions.(b)  A Federal agency may adjust requirements to a class of Federal awards, recipients, or subrecipients when required by Federal statutes or regulations, except for the requirements in subpart F. Except for provisions in subpart F, when a Federal statute requires exceptions to requirements of this part for a class of Federal awards, recipients, or subrecipients, a Federal agency does not need OMB approval to allow those exceptions. See also § 200.106.
Statutory and regulatory exceptions.(c)  Federal agencies may allow exceptions to requirements of this part on a case-by-case basis for individual Federal awards, recipients, or subrecipients, except when the exceptions are prohibited by law or other approval is expressly required by this part. Only the cognizant agency for indirect costs may authorize exceptions related to cost allocation plans or indirect cost rate proposals. A Federal agency may also apply less restrictive requirements when issuing fixed amount awards (see § 200.1), except for those requirements imposed by statute or in subpart F.




Federal agency exceptions.200.103SECTION1§ 200.103   Authorities.This part is issued under the following authorities.
(a) Subparts B through D are authorized under 31 U.S.C. 503 (the Chief Financial Officers Act, Functions of the Deputy Director for Management); the Federal Program Information Act (Pub, L. 95-220 and Pub. L. 98-169, as amended, codified at 31 U.S.C. 6101-6106); the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977 (Pub. L. 95-224, as amended, codified at 31 U.S.C. 6301-6309); 41 U.S.C. 1101-1131 (the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act); Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 and Executive Order 11541 (“Prescribing the Duties of the Office of Management and Budget and the Domestic Policy Council in the Executive Office of the President”); and the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507).
(b) Subpart E is authorized under the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, as amended; the Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950, as amended (31 U.S.C. 1101-1126); the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (31 U.S.C. 503-504); Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970; and Executive Order 11541, “Prescribing the Duties of the Office of Management and Budget and the Domestic Policy Council in the Executive Office of the President.” OMB also relies on authority under 31 U.S.C. 503 and 31 U.S.C. 6307.
(c) Subpart F is authorized under the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (codified at 31 U.S.C. 7501-7507). OMB also relies on authority under 31 U.S.C. 503 and 31 U.S.C. 6307.




200.104SECTION1§ 200.104   Supersession.This part superseded previous OMB guidance issued under Title 2, subtitle A, chapter II of the Code of Federal Regulations and certain OMB circulars related to uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards.




200.105SECTION1§ 200.105   Effect on other issuances.(a)  For Federal awards made subject to this part by a Federal agency, this part takes precedence over any administrative requirements, program manuals, handbooks, and other non-regulatory materials that are inconsistent with the requirements of this part upon implementation by the Federal agency, except to the extent that they are required by statute or authorized in accordance with § 200.102.
Superseding inconsistent requirements.(b)  Agencies may only impose legally binding requirements on recipients and subrecipients through:
Imposition of requirements on recipients.(1) Notice and public comment procedures through an approved agency process, including as authorized by this part, other statutes, or regulations; or
(2) Incorporating requirements into the terms and conditions of a Federal award as permitted by Federal statute, regulation, or this part.




200.106SECTION1§ 200.106   Agency implementation.The specific requirements and responsibilities of Federal agencies, non-Federal entities, recipients, and subrecipients are set forth in this part. Federal agencies making Federal awards to non-Federal entities must implement the language in subparts C through F of this part in codified regulations unless different provisions are required by Federal statute or are approved by OMB.




200.107SECTION1§ 200.107   OMB responsibilities.OMB will review Federal agency regulations and implementation of this part. OMB will provide interpretations of policy requirements and assistance to ensure effective, efficient, and consistent implementation. Any exceptions will be subject to approval by OMB and only with adequate justification from the Federal agency.




200.108SECTION1§ 200.108   Inquiries.Inquiries from Federal agencies concerning this part may be directed to OMB. Inquiries from recipients or subrecipients should be addressed to the Federal agency, the cognizant agency for indirect costs, the cognizant agency for audit, or the pass-through entity as appropriate.




200.109SECTION1§ 200.109   Review date.OMB will review this part periodically.




200.110SECTION1§ 200.110   Effective date.(a) The standards set forth in this part affecting the administration of Federal awards by Federal agencies become effective once implemented by Federal agencies or when any future amendment to this part becomes final.
(b) Existing negotiated indirect cost rates will remain in place until they expire. The effective date of changes to indirect cost rates must be based upon the date a newly re-negotiated rate goes into effect for the recipient's or subrecipient's fiscal year. Therefore, for indirect cost rates and cost allocation plans, the revisions to this part (as of the publication date for revisions to this guidance) become effective in generating proposals and negotiating a new rate (when the rate is re-negotiated).




200.111SECTION1§ 200.111   English language.(a) All Federal financial assistance announcements, applications, and Federal award information should be in the English language and must be in terms of U.S. dollars. However, Federal agencies, recipients, and subrecipients may issue or translate a Federal award or other documents into another language. A Federal agency may translate formal or informal announcements of the availability of Federal funding through a financial assistance program, such as a notice of funding opportunity, when translations may serve to increase the pool of applicants or the participation of a specific community (for example, programs administered in foreign countries where the primary language is not English). Federal agencies must maintain an official controlling English version of the Federal financial assistance announcement and the Federal award, including the terms and conditions.(b) Applications, reports, and official correspondence may be submitted in languages other than English if specified in the notice of funding opportunity or the terms and conditions of the Federal award.
(c) In the event of inconsistency between English and another language, the English language meaning will control. When a significant portion of the recipient's or subrecipient's employees administering a Federal award are not fluent in English, the Federal award should be provided in English and the language(s) with which employees are more familiar.




200.112SECTION1§ 200.112   Conflict of interest.Federal agencies must establish conflict of interest policies for Federal awards. A recipient or subrecipient must disclose in writing any potential conflict of interest to the Federal agency or pass-through entity in accordance with the established Federal agency policies.




200.113SECTION1§ 200.113   Mandatory disclosures.An applicant, recipient, or subrecipient of a Federal award must promptly disclose whenever, in connection with the Federal award (including any activities or subawards thereunder), it has credible evidence of the commission of a violation of Federal criminal law involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or gratuity violations found in Title 18 of the United States Code or a violation of the civil False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3733). The disclosure must be made in writing to the Federal agency, the agency's Office of Inspector General, and pass-through entity (if applicable). Recipients and subrecipients are also required to report matters related to recipient integrity and performance in accordance with Appendix XII of this part. Failure to make required disclosures can result in any of the remedies described in § 200.339. (See also 2 CFR part 180, 31 U.S.C. 3321, and 41 U.S.C. 2313.)


CSUBPARTSubpart C—Pre-Federal Award Requirements and Contents of Federal Awards200.200SECTION1§ 200.200   Purpose.Sections 200.201 through 200.217 prescribe instructions and other pre-award matters to be used by Federal agencies in the program planning, announcement, application, and award processes.




200.201SECTION1§ 200.201   Use of grants, cooperative agreements, fixed amount awards, and contracts.(a)  The Federal agency or pass-through entity must decide on the appropriate type of agreement for a Federal award (for example, a grant, cooperative agreement, subaward, or contract) in accordance with this guidance. See the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301-6309).
Federal awards.(b)  The Federal agency or pass-through entity (see § 200.333) may use fixed amount awards (see the definition of  in § 200.1) for which the following conditions apply:
Fixed amount awards.fixed amount awards(1) The Federal award amount is negotiated using the cost principles (or other pricing information) as a guide. See § 200.101(b)(4)(ii) for further information on which provisions in subpart E (cost principles) apply to fixed amount awards. The Federal agency or pass-through entity may use fixed amount awards if the project scope has measurable goals and objectives and if accurate cost, historical, or unit pricing data is available to establish a fixed budget based on a reasonable estimate of actual costs. Budgets for fixed amount awards are negotiated with the recipient or subrecipient and the total amount of Federal funding is determined in accordance with the recipient's or subrecipient's proposal, available pricing data, and subpart E. Accountability must be based on performance and results, which can be communicated in performance reports or through routine monitoring. There is no expected routine monitoring of the actual costs incurred by the recipient or subrecipient under the Federal award. Therefore, no financial reporting is required. This does not absolve the recipient or subrecipient from the record retention requirements contained in §§ 200.334 through 200.338; nor does it absolve the recipient or subrecipient of the responsibilities of making records available for review during an audit. See § 200.101(b)(5)(i). Payments must be based on meeting specific requirements of the Federal award. Some of the ways in which the Federal award may be paid include, but are not limited to:
(i) In several partial payments. The amount of each payment as well as the “milestone” or event triggering the payment, should be agreed to in advance and included in the Federal award;
(ii) On a unit price basis. The defined unit(s) or price(s) should be agreed to in advance and included in the Federal award; or
(iii) In one payment at the completion of the Federal award.
(2) A fixed amount award must not be used in programs that require cost sharing.
(3) A fixed amount award may generate and use program income in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Federal award; however, the requirements of § 200.307 do not apply.
(4) At the end of a fixed amount award, the recipient or subrecipient must certify in writing to the Federal agency or pass-through entity that the project was completed as agreed to in the Federal award, or identify those activities that were not completed, and that all expenditures were incurred in accordance with § 200.403. When the required activities were not carried out, including fixed amount awards paid on a unit price basis under 200.201(b)(1)(ii), the amount of the Federal award must be reduced by the amount that reflects the activities that were not completed in accordance with the Federal award. When the required activities were completed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Federal award, the recipient or subrecipient is entitled to any unexpended funds.
(5) Periodic reports may be established for fixed amount awards.
(6) Prior approval requirements that apply to fixed amount awards are § 200.308(f) (paragraphs 1 through 3, 6 through 8, and 10) and § 200.333.




200.202SECTION1§ 200.202   Program planning and design.(a) The Federal agency must design a program and create an Assistance Listing before announcing the Notice of Funding Opportunity. A program must be designed:
(1) With clear goals and objectives that provide meaningful results and be consistent with the Federal authorizing legislation of the program;
(2) To measure performance based on the goals and objectives developed during program planning and design. Performance measures may differ depending on the type of program. See § 200.301 for more information on performance measurement;
(3) To align with the strategic goals and objectives within the Federal agency's performance plan and support the Federal agency's performance measurement, management, customer service initiatives, and reporting as required by Part 6 of OMB Circular A-11 (Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget);
(4) To align with the Program Management Improvement Accountability Act (Pub. L. 114-264) as well as the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act (Pub. L. 115-435), as applicable; and
(5) To encourage applicants to engage, when practicable, during the design phase, members of the community that will benefit from or be impacted by a program.
(b) Federal agencies should develop programs in consultation with communities benefiting from or impacted by the program. In addition, Federal agencies should consider available data, evidence, and evaluation results from past programs and make every effort to extend eligibility requirements to all potential applicants. Federal agencies are encouraged to coordinate with other agencies during program planning and design, particularly when the goals and objectives of a program or project align with those of other agencies.




200.203SECTION1§ 200.203   Requirement to provide public notice of Federal financial assistance programs.(a) The Federal agency must maintain an accurate list of Federal programs in the Assistance Listings maintained by the General Services Administration (GSA) at 
SAM.gov.(1) The Assistance Listings is the comprehensive government-wide source of Federal financial assistance program information produced by the executive branch of the Federal Government.
(2) The information that the Federal agency must submit to GSA for approval by OMB is listed in paragraph (b). GSA must prescribe the format for the submission in coordination with OMB.
(3) The Federal agency must assign the appropriate Assistance Listing before making the Federal award unless exigent circumstances require otherwise (for example, timing requirements imposed by a Federal statute).
(b) To the extent practicable, the Federal agency must create, update, and manage Assistance Listing entries based on the authorizing statute for the program and comply with additional guidance provided by GSA (in consultation with OMB) to ensure consistent and accurate information is available to prospective applicants. Assistance Listings should be communicated to the public in plain language. Accordingly, Federal agencies must submit the following information to GSA when creating an Assistance Listing:
(1)  A brief summary of the statutory or regulatory requirements of the program and its intended outcome. Where appropriate, the program description, purpose, goals, and performance measurement should align with the strategic goals and objectives within the Federal agency's performance plan and should support the Federal agency's performance measurement, management, customer experience initiatives, and reporting as required by Part 6 of OMB Circular A-11;
Program Description, Purpose, Goals, and Measurement.(2)  Identification of whether the program will issue Federal awards on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis;
Identification.(3)  Estimates based on previous year funding are acceptable if current appropriations are not available at the time of the submission;
Projected total amount of funds available for the program.(4)  The statutory authority for funding the program and the agency, sub-agency, or specific program unit that will issue the Federal awards (to the extent possible) and associated funding identifier (for example, Treasury Account Symbol(s));
Anticipated source of available funds.(5)  The statutory, regulatory, or other eligibility factors or considerations that determine the applicant's qualification for Federal awards under the program (for example, type of recipient); and
General eligibility requirements.(6)  Applicability of Single Audit Requirements as required by subpart F.




Applicability of Single Audit Requirements.200.204SECTION1§ 200.204   Notices of funding opportunities.The Federal agency must announce specific funding opportunities for Federal financial assistance that will be openly competed. The term openly competed means opportunities that are not directed to one or more specifically identified applicants. To the extent possible, the Federal agency should communicate opportunities to the public in plain language to ensure the announcement is accessible to diverse communities of eligible applicants, including underserved communities. The Federal agency should also make efforts to limit the length and complexity of the announcement and only include the information that is necessary for the effective communication of the program objectives. Federal agencies may offer pre-application technical assistance or provide clarifying information for funding opportunities. However, Federal agencies must ensure these resources are made accessible and widely available to all potential applicants (for example, by posting answers to questions and requests on ). The Federal agency should make every effort to identify in the NOFO all eligible applicants (for example, different types of nonprofit organizations such as labor unions and tribal organizations). The following information must be provided in a public notice:
Grants.gov(a)  The Federal agency must display the following information on  in a location preceding the full text of the announcement:
Summary information in notices of funding opportunities.Grants.gov,(1) Federal Agency Name;
(2) Funding Opportunity Title;
(3) Announcement Type (whether the funding opportunity is the initial announcement or a modification of a previously announced opportunity);
(4) Funding Opportunity Number (required, if the Federal agency has assigned a number to the funding opportunity announcement);
(5) Assistance Listing Number(s);
(6) Funding Details. To the extent appropriate, the total amount of funding that the Federal agency expects to award, the anticipated number of awards, and the expected dollar values of individual awards, which may be a range or average;
(7) Key Dates. Key dates include due dates for submitting applications or Executive Order 12372 submissions, as well as for any letters of intent or preapplications. For any announcement issued before a program's application materials are available, key dates also include the date on which those materials will be released; and any other additional information, as deemed applicable by the Federal agency. If possible, the Federal agency should provide an anticipated award date. If the NOFO states that applications will be evaluated on a “rolling” basis (that is, at different points during a specified period of time), the Federal agency should provide an estimate of the time needed to process an application and notify the applicant of the Federal agency's decision;
(8) Executive Summary. A brief description that is written in plain language and summarizes the goals and objectives of the program, the target audience, and eligible applicants. The text of the executive summary should not exceed 500 words; and
(9) Agency contact information.
(b)  The Federal agency should make all funding opportunities available for application for at least 60 calendar days. However, the Federal agency may modify the availability period of an opportunity as needed. For example, extending the period may be necessary to provide technical assistance to an applicant pool that was not anticipated when the announcement was made or has less experience with applying for Federal financial assistance. The Federal agency may also determine that an availability period of less than 60 days is sufficient for a particular funding opportunity. However, no funding opportunity should be available for less than 30 calendar days unless the Federal agency determines that exigent circumstances justify this.
Availability period.(c)  (1) The Federal agency must include the information in Appendix I for every funding opportunity.
Full text of funding opportunities.(2) Federal agencies should ensure that funding opportunities are written using plain language. To the extent possible Federal agencies must streamline opportunities to make them accessible, particularly for funding opportunities that are new, targeted to underserved communities, or intended to reach inexperienced applicants.
(3) To reduce application burden, Federal agencies should consider whether programmatic or administrative requirements specific to the agency, program, or funding opportunity must be met at the time of application or as a requirement of receiving a Federal award.






200.205SECTION1§ 200.205   Federal agency review of merit of proposals.Unless prohibited by Federal statute, the Federal agency must design and execute a merit review process of applications for discretionary Federal awards. The objective of a merit review process is to select recipients most likely to be successful in delivering results based on the program objectives as outlined in section § 200.202. A merit review is an objective process of evaluating Federal award applications in accordance with the written standards of the Federal agency. These standards should identify the number of people the agency requires to participate in the merit review process and provide opportunities for a diverse group of participants, including those representing underserved communities. The merit review process explained in this section must be described or incorporated by reference in the applicable funding opportunity. See appendix I to this part. See also § 200.204. The Federal agency must also periodically review its merit review process.




200.206SECTION1§ 200.206   Federal agency review of risk posed by applicants.(a)  (1) Prior to making a Federal award, the Federal agency is required to review eligibility information for applicants and financial integrity information for applicants available in OMB-designated databases per the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (Pub. L. 116-117), the “Do Not Pay Initiative” (31 U.S.C. 3354), and 41 U.S.C. 2313.
Review of OMB-designated repositories of government-wide data.(2) The Federal agency is required to review the responsibility and qualification records available in the non-public segment of the System for Award Management () prior to making a Federal award where the Federal share is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, defined at 41 U.S.C. 134, over the period of performance. See 41 U.S.C. 2313. The Federal agency must consider all of the information available in  with regard to the applicant and any immediate highest-level owner, predecessor (meaning, an organization that is replaced by a successor), or subsidiary, identified for that applicant in . See Public Law 112-239, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013; 41 U.S.C. 2313(d). The information in the system for a prior recipient of a Federal award must demonstrate a satisfactory record of administering programs or activities under Federal financial assistance or procurement awards, and integrity and business ethics. The Federal agency may make a Federal award to a recipient that does not fully meet these standards if it is determined that the information is not relevant to the Federal award under consideration or there are specific conditions that can appropriately mitigate the risk associated with the recipient in accordance with § 200.208.
SAM.govSAM.govSAM.gov(b)  (1) The Federal agency must establish and maintain policies and procedures for conducting a risk assessment to evaluate the risks posed by applicants before issuing Federal awards. This assessment helps identify risks that may affect the advancement toward or the achievement of a project's goals and objectives. Risk assessments assist Federal managers in determining appropriate resources and time to devote to project oversight and monitor recipient progress. This assessment may incorporate elements such as the quality of the application, award amount, risk associated with the program, cybersecurity risks, fraud risks, and impacts on local jobs and the community. If the Federal agency determines that the Federal award will be made, specific conditions that address the assessed risk may be implemented in the Federal award. The risk criteria to be evaluated must be described in the announcement of the funding opportunity described in § 200.204.
Risk Assessment.(2) In evaluating risks posed by applicants, the Federal agency should consider the following items:
(i)  The applicant's record of effectively managing financial risks, assets, and resources;
Financial stability.(ii)  Quality of management systems and ability to meet the management standards prescribed in this part;
Management systems and standards.(iii)  The applicant's record of managing previous and current Federal awards, including compliance with reporting requirements and conformance to the terms and conditions of Federal awards, if applicable;
History of performance.(iv)  Reports and findings from audits performed under subpart F or the reports and findings of any other available audits, if applicable; and
Audit reports and findings.(v)  The applicant's ability to effectively implement statutory, regulatory, or other requirements imposed on recipients of Federal awards.
Ability to effectively implement requirements.(c)  The Federal agency may modify the risk assessment at any time during the period of performance, which may justify changes to the terms and conditions of the Federal award. See § 200.208.
Adjustments to the Risk Assessment.(d)  The Federal agency must comply with the government-wide suspension and debarment guidance in 2 CFR part 180 and individual Federal agency suspension and debarment requirements in title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Federal agencies must also require recipients to comply with these requirements. These requirements restrict making Federal awards, subawards, and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded from receiving Federal awards or participating in Federal awards.




Suspension and debarment compliance.200.207SECTION1§ 200.207   Standard application requirements.(a)  The Federal agency may only use application information collections approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and OMB's implementing regulations in 5 CFR part 1320 and in alignment with OMB-approved, government-wide data elements available from the OMB-designated standards lead. Examples of application information collections approved by OMB include the Standard Forms 424 (SF-424), which is available on , and the Biographical Sketch Common Form (OMB Control Number 3145-0279), which Federal agencies should use to collect biographical sketches and other disclosure information from award applicants. OMB will authorize additional information collections only on a limited basis and consistent with these requirements.
Paperwork clearances.Grants.gov(b)  The Federal agency may inform applicants that they do not need to provide certain information already being collected through other means.




Information collection.200.208SECTION1§ 200.208   Specific conditions.(a) Federal agencies are responsible for ensuring that specific Federal award conditions and performance expectations are consistent with the program design (See § 200.202 and § 200.301).
(b) The Federal agency or pass-through entity may adjust specific conditions in the Federal award based on an analysis of the following factors:
(1) Review of OMB-designated repositories of government-wide data (for example, ) or review of its risk assessment (See § 200.206);
SAM.gov(2) The recipient's or subrecipient's history of compliance with the terms and conditions of Federal awards;
(3) The recipient's or subrecipient's ability to meet expected performance goals as described in § 200.211; or
(4) A determination of whether a recipient or subrecipient has inadequate financial capability to perform the Federal award.
(c) Specific conditions may include the following:
(1) Requiring payments as reimbursements rather than advance payments;
(2) Withholding authority to proceed to the next phase until receipt of evidence of acceptable performance;
(3) Requiring additional or more detailed financial reports;

(2) The reason why the specific condition(s) is being imposed;
(3) The nature of the action needed to remove the specific condition(s);
(4) The time allowed for completing the actions; and
(5) The method for requesting the Federal agency or pass-through entity to reconsider imposing a specific condition.
(e) Any specific conditions must be promptly removed once the conditions that prompted them have been satisfied.




200.209SECTION1§ 200.209   Certifications and representations.Unless prohibited by the U.S. Constitution, Federal statutes, or regulations, a Federal agency or pass-through entity is authorized to require a recipient to submit annual certifications and representations. Submission may be required more frequently if a recipient or subrecipient fails to meet a requirement of a Federal award. When a recipient is provided an exception to the requirements of 2 CFR 25.110, the recipient must submit the appropriate assurance form (for example, SF-424B).




200.210SECTION1§ 200.210   Pre-award costs.For requirements on costs incurred by the applicant prior to the start date of the period of performance of the Federal award, see § 200.458.




200.211SECTION1§ 200.211   Information contained in a Federal award.The Federal award must include the following information:
(a)  Where applicable, performance goals, indicators, targets, and baseline data must be included in the Federal award. The Federal agency must also specify in the terms and conditions of the Federal award how performance will be assessed, including the timing and scope of expected performance.

(d) In implementing the prohibition under section 889 of Public Law 115-232, heads of executive agencies administering loan, grant, or subsidy programs must prioritize available funding and technical support to assist affected businesses, institutions, and organizations as is reasonably necessary for those affected entities to transition from covered telecommunications equipment or services, to procure replacement equipment or services, and to ensure that communications service to users and customers is sustained.
(e) When the recipient or subrecipient accepts a loan or grant, it is certifying that it will comply with the prohibition on covered telecommunications equipment and services in this section. The recipient or subrecipient is not required to certify that funds will not be expended on covered telecommunications equipment or services beyond the certification provided upon accepting the loan or grant and those provided upon submitting payment requests and financial reports.
(f) For additional information, see section 889 of Public Law 115-232 and § 200.471.




200.217SECTION1§ 200.217   Whistleblower protections.An employee of a recipient or subrecipient must not be discharged, demoted, or otherwise discriminated against as a reprisal for disclosing to a person or body described in paragraph (a)(2) of 41 U.S.C. 4712 information that the employee reasonably believes is evidence of gross mismanagement of a Federal contract or grant, a gross waste of Federal funds, an abuse of authority relating to a Federal contract or grant, a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, or a violation of law, rule, or regulation related to a Federal contract (including the competition for or negotiation of a contract) or grant. The recipient and subrecipient must inform their employees in writing of employee whistleblower rights and protections under 41 U.S.C. 4712. See statutory requirements for whistleblower protections at 10 U.S.C. 4701, 41 U.S.C. 4712, 41 U.S.C. 4304, and 10 U.S.C. 4310.




DSUBPARTSubpart D—Post Federal Award Requirements200.300SECTION1§ 200.300   Statutory and national policy requirements.(a) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must manage and administer the Federal award in a manner so as to ensure that Federal funding is expended and associated programs are implemented in full accordance with the U.S. Constitution, applicable Federal statutes and regulations—including provisions protecting free speech, religious liberty, public welfare, and the environment, and those prohibiting discrimination—and the requirements of this part. The Federal agency or pass-through entity must communicate to a recipient or subrecipient all relevant requirements, including those contained in general appropriations provisions, and incorporate them directly or by reference in the terms and conditions of the Federal award.
(b) In administering Federal awards that are subject to a Federal statute prohibiting discrimination based on sex, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must ensure that the award is administered in a way that does not unlawfully discriminate based on sexual orientation or gender identity if the statute's prohibition on sex discrimination encompasses discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity consistent with the Supreme Court's reasoning in  v.  140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020).
BostockClayton County,(c) In administering awards in accordance with the U.S. Constitution, the Federal agency must take account of the heightened constitutional scrutiny that may apply under the Constitution's Equal Protection guarantee for government action that provides differential treatment based on protected characteristics.




200.301SECTION1§ 200.301   Performance measurement.(a) The Federal agency must measure the recipient's performance to show achievement of program goals and objectives, share lessons learned, improve program outcomes, and foster the adoption of promising practices. The Federal agency should establish program goals and objectives during program planning and design (see § 200.202). The Federal agency should clearly communicate the specific program goals and objectives in the Federal award, including how the Federal agency will measure the achievement of the goals and objectives, the expected timeline, and information on how the recipient must report the achievement of program goals and objectives. The Federal agency should also clearly communicate in the Federal award any expected outcomes (such as outputs, service performance, or public impacts of any of these), indicators, targets, baseline data, or data collections that the recipient is responsible for measuring and reporting. The Federal agency must ensure all requirements for measuring performance align with the Federal agency's strategic goals, strategic objectives, or performance goals relevant to a program (see OMB Circular A-11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget Part 6).
(b) When establishing performance reporting frequency and content, the Federal agency should consider what information will be necessary to measure the recipient's progress, to identify promising practices of recipients, and build the evidence upon which the Federal agency makes program and performance decisions. The Federal agency should not require additional information that is not necessary for measuring program performance and evaluation. See § 200.329 for more information on reporting program performance.
(c) The Federal agency should also specify in the Federal award any requirements of the recipients' participation in federally funded evaluations.




200.302SECTION1§ 200.302   Financial management.(a) Each State must expend and account for the Federal award in accordance with State laws and procedures for expending and accounting for the State's funds. All recipient and subrecipient financial management systems, including records documenting compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award, must be sufficient to permit the preparation of reports required by the terms and conditions; and tracking expenditures to establish that funds have been used in accordance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. See § 200.450.
(b) The recipient's and subrecipient's financial management system must provide for the following (see §§ 200.334, 200.335, 200.336, and 200.337):
(1) Identification of all Federal awards received and expended and the Federal programs under which they were received. Federal program and Federal award identification must include, as applicable, the Assistance Listings title and number, Federal award identification number, year the Federal award was issued, and name of the Federal agency or pass-through entity.
(2) Accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial results of each Federal award or program in accordance with the reporting requirements in §§ 200.328 and 200.329. When a Federal agency or pass-through entity requires reporting on an accrual basis from a recipient or subrecipient that maintains its records other than on an accrual basis, the recipient or subrecipient must not be required to establish an accrual accounting system. This recipient or subrecipient may develop accrual data for its reports based on an analysis of the documentation on hand.
(3) Maintaining records that sufficiently identify the amount, source, and expenditure of Federal funds for Federal awards. These records must contain information necessary to identify Federal awards, authorizations, financial obligations, unobligated balances, as well as assets, expenditures, income, and interest. All records must be supported by source documentation.
(4) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property, and assets. The recipient or subrecipient must safeguard all assets and ensure they are used solely for authorized purposes. See § 200.303.
(5) Comparison of expenditures with budget amounts for each Federal award.
(6) Written procedures to implement the requirements of § 200.305.
(7) Written procedures for determining the allowability of costs in accordance with subpart E and the terms and conditions of the Federal award.




200.303SECTION1§ 200.303   Internal controls.The recipient and subrecipient must:
(a) Establish, document, and maintain effective internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the recipient or subrecipient is managing the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. These internal controls should align with the guidance in “Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government” issued by the Comptroller General of the United States or the “Internal Control-Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
(b) Comply with the U.S. Constitution, Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award.
(c) Evaluate and monitor the recipient's or subrecipient's compliance with statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards.
(d) Take prompt action when instances of noncompliance are identified.
(e) Take reasonable cybersecurity and other measures to safeguard information including protected personally identifiable information (PII) and other types of information. This also includes information the Federal agency or pass-through entity designates as sensitive or other information the recipient or subrecipient considers sensitive and is consistent with applicable Federal, State, local, and tribal laws regarding privacy and responsibility over confidentiality.




200.304SECTION1§ 200.304   Bonds.(a) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, the Federal agency may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the recipient are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government.
(b) The Federal agency may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks coverage to protect the interest of the Federal Government.
(c) Where bonds, insurance, or both are required in the situations described above, the bonds and insurance must be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury (see 31 CFR part 223).




200.305SECTION1§ 200.305   Federal payment.(a)  Payments for States are governed by Treasury-State Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) agreements and default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205 and Treasury Financial Manual (TFM) 4A-2000, “Overall Disbursing Rules for All Federal Agencies.”
Payments for States.(b)  For recipients and subrecipients other than States, payment methods must minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the Federal agency or the pass-through entity and the disbursement of funds by the recipient or subrecipient regardless of whether the payment is made by electronic funds transfer or by other means. See § 200.302(b)(6). Except as noted in this part, the Federal agency must require recipients to use only OMB-approved, government-wide information collections to request payment.
Payments for recipients and subrecipients other than States.(1) The recipient or subrecipient must be paid in advance, provided it maintains or demonstrates the willingness to maintain both written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient or subrecipient, and financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in this part. Advance payments to a recipient or subrecipient must be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed with actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient or subrecipient in carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project. The timing and amount of advance payments must be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient or subrecipient for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs. The recipient or subrecipient must make timely payments to contractors in accordance with the contract provisions.
(2) Whenever possible, advance payment requests by the recipient or subrecipient must be consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all Federal awards received by the recipient from the awarding Federal agency or pass-through entity.
(i) Advance payment mechanisms must comply with 31 CFR part 208 and include, but are not limited to, Treasury checks and electronic funds transfers.
(ii) Recipients and subrecipients must be authorized to submit payment requests as often as necessary when electronic fund transfers are used or at least monthly when electronic transfers are not used. See Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693-1693r).
(3) Reimbursement is preferred when the requirements in paragraph (b) cannot be met, when the Federal agency or pass-through entity sets a specific condition per § 200.208, when requested by the recipient or subrecipient, when a Federal award is for construction, or when a significant portion of the construction project is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans and the Federal award constitutes a minor portion of the project. When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must make payment within 30 calendar days after receipt of the payment request unless the Federal agency or pass-through entity reasonably believes the request to be improper.
(4) If the recipient or subrecipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and the Federal agency or pass-through entity has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the recipient or subrecipient lacks sufficient working capital, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must advance cash payments to the recipient or subrecipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally aligned to the recipient's or subrecipient's disbursing cycle. After that, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must reimburse the recipient or subrecipient for its actual cash disbursements. Use of the working capital advance payment method requires that the pass-through entity provide timely advance payments to any subrecipients to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements. The pass-through entity must not use the working capital advance method of payment if the reason for using this method is the unwillingness or inability of the pass-through entity to provide timely advance payments to the subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.
(5) If available, the recipient or subrecipient must disburse funds available from program income (including repayments to a revolving fund), rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries, and interest earned on Federal funds before requesting additional cash payments.
(6) Payments for allowable costs must not be withheld at any time during the period of performance unless required by Federal statute, regulations, or in one of the following instances:
(i) The recipient or subrecipient has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award; or
(ii) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A-129, “Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables.” Under such conditions, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may, after providing reasonable notice, withhold payments to the recipient or subrecipient for financial obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected or the debt is repaid to the Federal Government.
(7) A payment withheld for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award must be released to the recipient or subrecipient upon subsequent compliance. When a Federal award is suspended, payment adjustments must be made in accordance with § 200.343.
(8) A payment must not be made to a recipient or subrecipient for amounts that the recipient or subrecipient withholds from contractors to assure satisfactory completion of work. Payment must be made when the recipient or subrecipient disburses the withheld funds to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to ensure satisfactory completion of work.
(9) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must not require separate depository accounts for funds provided to the recipient or subrecipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories. However, the recipient or subrecipient must be able to account for all Federal funds received, obligated, and expended.
(10) Advance payments of Federal funds must be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible.
(11) The recipient or subrecipient must maintain advance payments of Federal funds in interest-bearing accounts unless one of the following applies:
(i) The recipient or subrecipient receives less than $250,000 in Federal funding per year;
(ii) The best available interest-bearing account would not reasonably be expected to earn interest in excess of $500 per year on Federal cash balances;
(iii) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible with the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources;
(iv) A foreign government or banking system prohibits or precludes interest-bearing accounts; or
(v) An interest-bearing account is not readily accessible (for example, due to public or political unrest in a foreign country).
(12) The recipient or subrecipient may retain up to $500 per year of interest earned on Federal funds to use for administrative expenses of the recipient or subrecipient. Any additional interest earned on Federal funds must be returned annually to the Department of Health and Human Services Payment Management System (PMS) through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network or a Fedwire Funds Service payment. All interest in excess of $500 per year must be returned to PMS regardless of whether the recipient or subrecipient was paid through PMS. Instructions for returning interest can be found at 
https://pms.psc.gov/grant-recipients/returning-funds-interest.html.(13) All other Federal funds must be returned to the payment system of the Federal agency. Returns should follow the instructions provided by the Federal agency. All returns to PMS should follow the instructions provided at 




https://pms.psc.gov/grant-recipients/returning-funds-interest.html.200.306SECTION1§ 200.306   Cost sharing.(a) Voluntary committed cost sharing is not expected under Federal research grants. The Federal agency may not use voluntary committed cost sharing as a factor during the merit review of applications or proposals for Federal research grants unless authorized by Federal statutes or agency regulations and specified in the notice of funding opportunity. Federal agencies are also discouraged from using voluntary committed cost sharing as a factor during the merit review of applications for other Federal financial assistance programs. If voluntary committed cost sharing is used for this purpose for other programs, the notice of funding opportunity must specify how an applicant's proposed cost sharing will be considered. See §§ 200.414, 200.204, and Appendix I.
(b) For all Federal awards, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must accept any cost sharing funds (including cash and third-party in-kind contributions, and also including funds committed by the recipient, subrecipient, or third parties) as part of the recipient's or subrecipient's contributions to a program when the funds:
(1) Are verifiable in the recipient's or subrecipient's records;
(2) Are not included as contributions for any other Federal award;
(3) Are necessary and reasonable for achieving the objectives of the Federal award;
(4) Are allowable under subpart E;
(5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another Federal award, except where the program's Federal authorizing statute specifically provides that Federal funds made available for the program can be applied to cost sharing requirements of other Federal programs;
(6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by the Federal agency; and
(7) Conform to other applicable provisions of this part.
(c) Unrecovered indirect costs, including indirect costs on cost sharing, may be included as part of cost sharing with the prior approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity. Unrecovered indirect cost means the difference between the amount charged to the Federal award and the amount which could have been charged to the Federal award under the recipient's or subrecipient's approved indirect cost rate.
(d) Values for recipient or subrecipient contributions of services and property must be established in accordance with the cost principles in subpart E. When a Federal agency or pass-through entity authorizes the recipient or subrecipient to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities acquisition projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing must be the lesser of paragraph (d)(1) or (2) below.
(1) The value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's or subrecipient's accounting records at the time of donation.
(2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, the Federal agency or pass-through may approve using the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the value described in paragraph (d)(1) at the time of donation.
(e) Volunteer services furnished by third-party professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other labor may be counted as cost sharing if the service is necessary for the program. Rates for third-party volunteer services must be consistent with those paid for similar work by the recipient or subrecipient. When the required skills are not found in the recipient's or subrecipient's workforce, rates must be consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market where the recipient or subrecipient competes for the services involved. In either case, fringe benefits that are allowable, allocable, and reasonable may be included in the valuation.
(f) When a third-party organization furnishes the services of an employee, these services must be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay plus an amount of fringe benefits that is reasonable, necessary, allocable, and otherwise allowable, and indirect costs at either the third-party organization's approved federally-negotiated indirect cost rate or, a rate in accordance with § 200.414(d) provided these services employ the same skill(s) for which the employee is normally paid. Where donated services are treated as indirect costs, indirect cost rates will separate the value of the donated services so that reimbursement for the donated services will not be made.
(g) Donated property from third parties may include items such as equipment, office supplies, laboratory supplies, or workshop and classroom supplies. The assessed value of donated property included as cost sharing must not exceed the property's fair market value at the time of the donation.
(h) The method used for determining the value of donated equipment, buildings, and land for which title passes to the recipient or subrecipient may differ according to the following:
(1) If the purpose of the Federal award is to assist the recipient or subrecipient in acquiring equipment, buildings, or land, the aggregate value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing.
(2) If the purpose of the Federal award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings, or land, only depreciation charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the fair market value of equipment or other capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed if provided in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. See § 200.420.
(i) The value of donated property must be determined in accordance with the accounting policies of the recipient or subrecipient with the following qualifications:
(1) The value of donated land and buildings must not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient or subrecipient as established by an independent appraiser (for example, certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient or subrecipient as required by the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) except as provided in the implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24, “Uniform Relocation Assistance And Real Property Acquisition For Federal And Federally-Assisted Programs.”
(2) The value of donated equipment must not exceed the fair market value at the time of donation.
(3) The value of donated space must not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality.
(4) The value of loaned equipment must not exceed its fair rental value.
(j) The fair market value of third-party in-kind contributions must be documented and, to the extent feasible, supported by the same methods used internally by the recipient or subrecipient.
(k) For institutions of higher education (IHE), voluntary uncommitted cost sharing should be treated differently from mandatory or voluntary committed cost sharing. Voluntary uncommitted cost sharing should not be included in the organized research base for computing the indirect cost rate or reflected in any allocation of indirect costs. Voluntary uncommitted cost sharing includes faculty-donated additional time above that agreed to as part of the award. See OMB memorandum M-01-06, dated January 5, 2001, Clarification of OMB A-21 Treatment of Voluntary Uncommitted Cost Sharing and Tuition Remission Costs.




200.307SECTION1§ 200.307   Program income.(a)  The recipient or subrecipient is encouraged to earn income to defray program costs when appropriate. Program income must be used for the original purpose of the Federal award. Program income earned during the period of performance may only be used for costs incurred during the period of performance or allowable closeout costs. See § 200.472(b). Program income must be expended prior to requesting additional Federal funds. Program income exceeding amounts specified in the Federal award may be added to or deducted from the total allowable costs in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Federal award.
General.(b)  There are three methods of applying program income: deduction; addition; and cost-sharing. The Federal agency should specify what program income method(s) will be used in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. The deduction method will be used if the Federal agency does not specify a method for applying program income. When no program income method is specified in the Federal award, prior approval is required to use the addition or cost sharing methods. However, the addition method will be used when no method is specified for awards made to institutions of higher education (IHE) and nonprofit research institutions. In specifying alternatives to the deduction and addition methods, the Federal agency may distinguish between income earned by the recipient and income earned by subrecipients as well as between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income.
Use of program income.(1)  Program income is deducted from the total allowable costs, reducing the overall total amount of the Federal award.
Deduction.(2)  Program income is added to the total allowable costs, increasing the overall total amount of the Federal award.
Addition.(3)  Program income is used to meet the Federal award's cost sharing requirement.
Cost sharing.(c)  There are no requirements governing the disposition of program income earned after the end of the period of performance of the Federal award unless stipulated in the Federal agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the Federal award. The Federal agency may negotiate agreements with recipients regarding appropriate uses of income earned after the end of the period of performance as part of the closeout process. See § 200.344.
Income after the period of performance.(d)  If authorized by Federal regulations or the Federal award, costs incidental to generating program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these costs have not been charged to the Federal award.
Cost of generating program income.(e)  The following are not considered program income unless specified in Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award:
Not considered program income.(1)  Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines, and similar revenues the recipient or subrecipient raised.
Governmental revenues.(2)  Proceeds from the sale of real property, equipment, or supplies. The proceeds must be handled in accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards of §§ 200.311, 200.313, 200.314, or as explicitly identified in Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award.
Property.(3)  License fees and royalties for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions made under the Federal award subject to 37 CFR part 401.




License fees and royalties.200.308SECTION1§ 200.308   Revision of budget and program plans.(a)  The approved budget for the Federal award summarizes the financial aspects of the project or program as approved during the Federal award process. It may include the Federal share and non-Federal share or only the Federal share, as determined by the Federal agency or pass-through entity.
Approved budget in general.(b)  The recipient or subrecipient must report deviations from the approved budget, project or program scope, or objective(s) in accordance with § 200.329. The recipient or subrecipient must request prior approvals from the Federal agency or pass-through entity for budget and program plan revisions in accordance with this section.
Deviations from approved budget.(c)  When requesting approval for budget revisions, the recipient or subrecipient must use the same format for budget information that was used in their application, except if the Federal agency has approved an alternative format. Alternative formats may include the use of electronic systems, email, or other agency-approved mechanisms that document the request.
Requesting approval for budget revisions.(d)  The Federal agency or pass-through entity must review the request for budget or program plan revision and should notify the recipient or subrecipient whether the revisions have been approved within 30 days of receipt of the request. The Federal agency or pass-through entity must inform the recipient or subrecipient in writing when a decision can be expected if more than 30 days is required for a review.
Federal agency or pass-through entity review.(e)  Unless specified in this guidance, the Federal agency must not impose additional prior approval requirements without OMB approval. See also §§ 200.102 and 200.407.
Limitation on other prior approval requirements.(f)  A recipient or subrecipient must request prior written approval from the Federal agency or pass-through entity for the following program and budget-related reasons:
Revisions Requiring Prior Approval.(1) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if there is no associated budget revision requiring prior written approval).
(2) Change in key personnel (including employees and contractors) that are identified by name or position in the Federal award.
(3) The disengagement from a project for more than three months, or a 25 percent reduction in time and effort devoted to the Federal award over the course of the period of performance, by the approved project director or principal investigator.
(4) The inclusion, unless waived by the Federal agency, of costs that require prior approval in accordance with subpart E as applicable.
(5) The transfer of funds budgeted for participant support costs to other budget categories.
(6) Subaward activities not proposed in the application and approved in the Federal award. A change of subrecipient only requires prior approval if the Federal agency or pass-through entity includes the requirement in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. In general, a Federal agency or pass-through entity should not require prior approval of a change of subrecipient unless the inclusion was a determining factor in the merit review or eligibility process. This requirement does not apply to procurement transactions for goods and services.
(7) Changes in the total approved cost-sharing amount.
(8) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project. Before providing approval, the Federal agency must ensure that adequate funds are available to avoid a violation of the Antideficiency Act.
(9) Transferring funds between the construction and non-construction work under a Federal award.
(10) A no-cost extension (meaning, an extension of time that does not require the obligation of additional Federal funds) of the period of performance, other than any one-time extension authorized by the Federal agency in accordance with paragraph (g)(2). All requests for no-cost extensions should be submitted at least 10 calendar days before the conclusion of the period of performance. The Federal agency may approve multiple no-cost extensions under a Federal award if not prohibited by Federal statute or regulation.
(g)  Except for the requirements listed in paragraphs (f)(1) through (10), the Federal agency is authorized to waive other cost-related and administrative prior written approval requirements contained in subparts D and E. Such waivers may include authorizing recipients to do one or more of the following:
Waiver of certain prior approvals.(1)  Incur project costs 90 calendar days before the Federal award date. Expenses incurred more than 90 calendar days before the Federal award date require prior approval of the Federal agency. All costs incurred before the Federal award date are at the recipient's own risk ( the Federal agency is not required to reimburse such costs if the recipient does not receive the Federal award or if the Federal award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs). Pre-award costs must be charged to the initial budget period of the Federal award unless otherwise specified by the Federal agency. See also § 200.458.
Pre-award costs.for example,(2)  Initiate a one-time extension of the period of performance by up to 12 months unless one or more of the conditions outlined in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section apply. Prior approval is not required if a recipient is authorized in the terms and conditions of the Federal award to initiate a one-time extension. However, the recipient must notify the Federal agency in writing with the supporting justification and a revised period of performance at least 10 calendar days before the conclusion of the period of performance. A one-time extension may not be exercised for the sole purpose of using unobligated balances. This paragraph does not preclude the Federal agency from approving further no-cost extensions to the Federal award. One-time extensions require prior approval from the Federal agency when:
One-time extensions.(i) The terms and conditions of the Federal award prohibit the extension;
(ii) The extension requires additional Federal funds; or
(iii) The extension involves any change in the approved scope of the project.
(3)  Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent budget periods.
Unobligated Balances.(h)  The prior approval requirements for the actions described in paragraph (g) of this section are automatically waived for Federal awards that support research unless stipulated in the Federal agency's regulations or terms and conditions of the Federal award. However, one-time extensions require the Federal agency's prior approval when one of the conditions in paragraph (g)(2) of this section applies.
Prior approvals for research awards.(i)  The Federal agency must not permit a transfer of funds that would cause any Federal appropriation to be used for purposes other than those consistent with the appropriation. The Federal agency may also, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories (for example, personnel, travel, and supplies) or programs, functions, and activities when:
Transfer of funds.(1) The Federal share of the Federal award exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold; and
(2) The cumulative amount of a transfer exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget, including cost share, as last approved by the Federal agency.




200.309SECTION1§ 200.309   Modifications to Period of Performance.When the Federal agency or pass-through entity approves an extension to a Federal award, or if a recipient extends under § 200.308(g)(2), the period of performance will be amended to end at the completion of the extension. If termination occurs, the period of performance will be amended to end upon the effective date of termination. The start date of a renewal award begins a new and distinct period of performance.


ECFR8feb98c2e3e5ad2SUBJGRPProperty Standards200.310SECTION1§ 200.310   Insurance coverage.The recipient or subrecipient must, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired or improved with Federal funds as provided to property and equipment owned by the recipient or subrecipient. Insurance is not required for Federally owned property unless required by the terms and conditions of the Federal award.




200.311SECTION1§ 200.311   Real property.(a)  Subject to the requirements and conditions set forth in this section, title to real property acquired or improved under the Federal award will vest upon acquisition in the recipient or subrecipient.
Title.(b)  Except as otherwise provided by Federal statutes or the Federal agency, real property must be used for the originally authorized purpose as long as it is needed for that purpose. While the property is being used for the originally authorized purpose, the recipient or subrecipient must not dispose of or encumber its title or other interests except as provided by the Federal agency. Easements for utility, cable, and similar services that benefit the real property and are consistent with the authorized use are not considered an encumbrance.
Use.(c)  When an appraisal of real property is required and obtained by the recipient or subrecipient, it must be conducted by an independent appraiser (for example, certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient or subrecipient as required by the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) except as provided in the implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24, “Uniform Relocation Assistance And Real Property Acquisition For Federal And Federally-Assisted Programs.”
Appraisals.(d)  When real property is no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, the recipient or subrecipient must obtain disposition instructions from the Federal agency or pass-through entity. The instructions must specify one of the following disposition methods:
Disposition.(1)  When the recipient or subrecipient retains title to the property, it must pay the Federal agency an amount calculated by multiplying the percentage of the Federal agency's contribution towards the original purchase (and costs of any improvements) by the current fair market value of the property. However, in situations where the recipient or subrecipient is disposing of real property acquired or improved with the Federal award and acquiring replacement real property under the same Federal award, the net proceeds from the disposition may be used as an offset to the cost of the replacement property.
Retain title after compensating the Federal agency.(2)  When a recipient or subrecipient sells the property, it must pay the Federal agency an amount calculated by multiplying the percentage of the Federal agency's contribution towards the original purchase (and cost of any improvements) by the proceeds of the sale after deducting any actual and reasonable expenses paid to sell or fix up the property for sale. When the Federal award has not been closed out, the net proceeds from the sale may be offset against the original cost of the property. When directed to sell the property, the recipient or subrecipient must sell the property utilizing procedures that provide for competition to the extent practicable and that result in the highest possible return.
Sell the property and compensate the Federal agency.(3)  When a recipient or subrecipient transfers title to the property to a Federal agency or third party designated or approved by the Federal agency, the recipient or subrecipient is entitled to be paid an amount calculated by multiplying the percentage of the recipient's or subrecipient's contribution towards the original purchase of the real property (and cost of any improvements) by the current fair market value of the property.




Transfer title to the Federal agency or a third party designated/approved by the Federal agency.200.312SECTION1§ 200.312   Federally owned and exempt property.(a) Title to Federally owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. The recipient or subrecipient must submit an inventory listing of Federally owned property in its custody to the Federal agency or pass-through entity on an annual basis. The recipient or subrecipient must request disposition instructions from the Federal agency or pass-through entity upon completion of the Federal award or when the property is no longer needed.
(b) If the Federal agency has no further need for the property, it must declare the property excess and report it for disposal to the appropriate Federal disposal authority unless the Federal agency has statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods ( the authority provided by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710(i)). The Federal agency or pass-through entity must issue appropriate instructions to the recipient or subrecipient.
for example,(c) Exempt property means property acquired under the Federal award where the Federal agency has chosen to vest title to the property to the recipient or subrecipient without further responsibility to the Federal Government. The Federal agency may only exercise this option when permitted by Federal statute and set forth in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. Absent statutory authority and specific terms and conditions of the Federal award, the title to exempt property acquired under the Federal award remains with the Federal Government.




200.313SECTION1§ 200.313   Equipment.See also § 200.439.
(a)  Title to equipment acquired under the Federal award will vest upon acquisition in the recipient or subrecipient subject to the conditions of this section. This title must be a conditional title unless a Federal statute specifically authorizes the Federal agency to vest title in the recipient or subrecipient without further responsibility to the Federal Government (and the Federal agency elects to do so). A conditional title means a clear title is withheld by the Federal agency until conditions and requirements specified in the terms and conditions of a Federal award have been fulfilled. Title for equipment vested in a recipient or subrecipient is subject to the following conditions:
Title.(1) Use the equipment for the authorized purposes of the project during the period of performance or until the property is no longer needed for the purposes of the project.
(2) While the equipment is being used for the originally-authorized purpose, the recipient or subrecipient must not dispose of or encumber its title or other interests without the approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity.
(3) Use and dispose of the property in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c), and (e) of this section.
(b)  A State must use, manage and dispose of equipment acquired under a Federal award in accordance with State laws and procedures. Indian Tribes must use, manage, and dispose of equipment acquired under a Federal award in accordance with tribal laws and procedures. If such laws and procedures do not exist, Indian Tribes must follow the guidance in this section. Other recipients and subrecipients, including subrecipients of a State or Indian Tribe, must follow paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.
General.(c)  (1) The recipient or subrecipient must use equipment for the project or program for which it was acquired and for as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by the Federal award. The recipient or subrecipient must not encumber the equipment without prior approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity. The Federal agency may require the submission of the applicable common forms for reporting on equipment. When no longer needed for the original project or program, the equipment may be used in other activities in the following order of priority:
Use.(i) Activities under other Federal awards from the Federal agency that funded the original program or project; then
(ii) Activities under Federal awards from other Federal agencies. These activities include consolidated equipment for information technology systems.
(2) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient or subrecipient must also make the equipment available for use on other programs or projects supported by the Federal Government, provided that such use will not interfere with the purpose for which it was originally acquired. First preference for other use of the equipment must be given to other programs or projects supported by the Federal agency that financed the equipment. Second preference must be given to programs or projects under Federal awards from other Federal agencies. Use for non-federally-funded projects is also permissible, provided such use will not interfere with the purpose for which it was originally acquired. The recipient or subrecipient should consider charging user fees as appropriate.
(3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in § 200.307 to earn program income, the recipient or subrecipient must not use equipment acquired with the Federal award to provide services for a fee that is less than a private company would charge for similar services unless specifically authorized by Federal statute. This restriction is effective as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment.
(4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient or subrecipient may either trade-in or sell the equipment and use the proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement equipment.
(d)  Regardless of whether equipment is acquired in part or its entirety under the Federal award, the recipient or subrecipient must manage equipment (including replacement equipment) utilizing procedures that meet the following requirements:
Management requirements.(1) Property records must include a description of the property, a serial number or another identification number, the source of funding for the property (including the FAIN), the title holder, the acquisition date, the cost of the property, the percentage of the Federal agency contribution towards the original purchase, the location, use and condition of the property, and any disposition data including the date of disposal and sale price of the property. The recipient and subrecipient are responsible for maintaining and updating property records when there is a change in the status of the property.
(2) A physical inventory of the property must be conducted, and the results must be reconciled with the property records at least once every two years.
(3) A control system must be in place to ensure safeguards for preventing property loss, damage, or theft. Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment must be investigated. The recipient or subrecipient must notify the Federal agency or pass-through entity of any loss, damage, or theft of equipment that will have an impact on the program.
(4) Regular maintenance procedures must be in place to ensure the property is in proper working condition.
(5) If the recipient or subrecipient is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures must be in place to ensure the highest possible return.
(e)  When equipment acquired under a Federal award is no longer needed for the original project, program, or for other activities currently or previously supported by a Federal agency, the recipient or subrecipient must request disposition instructions from the Federal agency or pass-through entity if required by the terms and conditions of the Federal award. Disposition of the equipment will be made as follows, in accordance with Federal agency or pass-through entity disposition instructions:
Disposition.(1) Equipment with a current fair market value of $10,000 or less (per unit) may be retained, sold, or otherwise disposed of with no further responsibility to the Federal agency or pass-through entity.
(2) Except as provided in § 200.312(b), or if the Federal agency or pass-through entity fails to provide requested disposition instructions within 120 days, items of equipment with a current fair market value in excess of $10,000 (per-unit) may be retained or sold by the recipient or subrecipient. However, the Federal agency is entitled to an amount calculated by multiplying the percentage of the Federal agency's contribution towards the original purchase by the current market value or proceeds from the sale. If the equipment is sold, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may permit the recipient or subrecipient to retain, from the Federal share, $1,000 of the proceeds to cover expenses associated with the selling and handling of the equipment.
(3) The recipient or subrecipient may transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third party provided that the recipient or subrecipient must be entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the property.
(4) In cases where a recipient or subrecipient fails to take appropriate disposition actions, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may direct the recipient or subrecipient to take disposition actions.
(f)  When included in the terms and conditions of the Federal award, the Federal agency may permit the recipient to retain equipment, or authorize a pass-through entity to permit the subrecipient to retain equipment, with no further obligation to the Federal Government unless prohibited by Federal statute or regulation.






Equipment retention.200.314SECTION1§ 200.314   Supplies.See also § 200.453.
(a) Title to supplies acquired under the Federal award will vest upon acquisition in the recipient or subrecipient. When there is a residual inventory of unused supplies exceeding $10,000 in aggregate value at the end of the period of performance, and the supplies are not needed for any other Federal award, the recipient or subrecipient may retain or sell the unused supplies. Unused supplies means supplies that are in new condition, not having been used or opened before. The aggregate value of unused supplies consists of all supply types, not just like-item supplies. The Federal agency or pass-through entity is entitled to compensation in an amount calculated by multiplying the percentage of the Federal agency's or pass-through entity's contribution towards the cost of the original purchase(s) by the current market value or proceeds from the sale. If the supplies are sold, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may permit the recipient or subrecipient to retain, from the Federal share, $1,000 of the proceeds to cover expenses associated with the selling and handling of the supplies.
(b) Unless expressly authorized by Federal statute, the recipient or subrecipient must not use supplies acquired with the Federal award to provide services for a fee that is less than a private company would charge for similar services. This restriction is effective as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the supplies or as authorized by Federal statute.




200.315SECTION1§ 200.315   Intangible property.(a) Title to intangible property acquired under a Federal award vests upon acquisition in the recipient or subrecipient. The recipient or subrecipient must use that intangible property for the originally authorized purpose and must not encumber the property without the approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity. When no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, disposition of the intangible property must occur in accordance with the provisions in § 200.313(e).
(b) To the extent permitted by law, the recipient or subrecipient may copyright any work that is subject to copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was acquired, under a Federal award. The Federal agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes and to authorize others to do so. This includes the right to require recipients and subrecipients to make such works available through agency-designated public access repositories.
(c) The recipient or subrecipient is subject to applicable regulations governing patents and inventions, including government-wide regulations in 37 CFR part 401.
(d) The Federal Government has the right to:
(1) Obtain, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the data produced under a Federal award; and
(2) Authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the data for Federal purposes.
(e)(1) The recipient or subrecipient must provide research data relating to published research findings produced under the Federal award and that were used by the Federal Government in developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law if requested by the Federal agency in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. When the Federal agency obtains the research data solely in response to a FOIA request, the Federal agency may charge the requester a fee for the cost of obtaining the research data. This fee should reflect the costs incurred by the Federal agency and the recipient or subrecipient. This fee is in addition to any fees the Federal agency may assess under the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)).
(2) Published research findings mean:
(i) Research findings published in a peer-reviewed scientific or technical journal; or
(ii) Research findings publicly cited by a Federal agency in developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law.
(3) Research data means the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings. Research data does not include any of the following:
(i) Preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or communications with colleagues. This “recorded” material excludes physical objects (for example, laboratory samples).
(ii) Trade secrets, commercial information, materials necessary to be held confidential by a researcher until they are published, or similar information which is protected under law; and
(iii) Personnel, medical, and other personally identifiable information that, if disclosed, would constitute an invasion of personal privacy. Information that could identify a particular person in a research study is not considered research data.
(f) Federal agencies should work with recipients to maximize public access to Federally funded research results and data in a manner that protects data providers' confidentiality, privacy, and security. Agencies should provide guidance to recipients to make restricted-access data available through a variety of mechanisms. FOIA may not be the most appropriate mechanism for providing access to intangible property, including Federally funded research results and data.




200.316SECTION1§ 200.316   Property trust relationship.Real property, equipment, and intangible property acquired or improved with the Federal award must be held in trust by the recipient or subrecipient as trustee for the beneficiaries of the project or program under which the property was acquired or improved. The Federal agency or pass-through entity may require the recipient or subrecipient to record liens or other appropriate notices of record to indicate that personal or real property has been acquired or improved with a Federal award and that use and disposition conditions apply to the property.


ECFR45ddd4419ad436dSUBJGRPProcurement Standards200.317SECTION1§ 200.317   Procurements by States and Indian Tribes.When conducting procurement transactions under a Federal award, a State or Indian Tribe must follow the same policies and procedures it uses for procurements with non-Federal funds. If such policies and procedures do not exist, States and Indian Tribes must follow the procurement standards in §§ 200.318 through 200.327. In addition to its own policies and procedures, a State or Indian Tribe must also comply with the following procurement standards: §§ 200.321, 200.322, 200.323, and 200.327. All other recipients and subrecipients, including subrecipients of a State or Indian Tribe, must follow the procurement standards in §§ 200.318 through 200.327.




200.318SECTION1§ 200.318   General procurement standards.(a)  The recipient or subrecipient must maintain and use documented procedures for procurement transactions under a Federal award or subaward, including for acquisition of property or services. These documented procurement procedures must be consistent with State, local, and tribal laws and regulations and the standards identified in §§ 200.317 through 200.327.
Documented procurement procedures.(b)  Recipients and subrecipients must maintain oversight to ensure that contractors perform in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase orders. See also § 200.501(h).
Oversight of contractors.(c)  (1) The recipient or subrecipient must maintain written standards of conduct covering conflicts of interest and governing the actions of its employees engaged in the selection, award, and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, agent, or board member with a real or apparent conflict of interest may participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by the Federal award. A conflict of interest includes when the employee, officer, agent, or board member, any member of their immediate family, their partner, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in or a tangible personal benefit from an entity considered for a contract. An employee, officer, agent, and board member of the recipient or subrecipient may neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors. However, the recipient or subrecipient may set standards for situations where the financial interest is not substantial or a gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The recipient's or subrecipient's standards of conduct must also provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations by its employees, officers, agents, or board members.
Conflicts of interest.(2) If the recipient or subrecipient has a parent, affiliate, or subsidiary organization that is not a State, local government, or Indian Tribe, the recipient or subrecipient must also maintain written standards of conduct covering organizational conflicts of interest. Organizational conflicts of interest mean that because of relationships with a parent company, affiliate, or subsidiary organization, the recipient or subrecipient is unable or appears to be unable to be impartial in conducting a procurement action involving a related organization.
(d)  The recipient's or subrecipient's procedures must avoid the acquisition of unnecessary or duplicative items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking out procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. When appropriate, an analysis should be made between leasing and purchasing property or equipment to determine the most economical approach.
Avoidance of unnecessary or duplicative items.(e)  When appropriate for the procurement or use of common or shared goods and services, recipients and subrecipients are encouraged to enter into State and local intergovernmental agreements or inter-entity agreements for procurement transactions. These or similar procurement arrangements using strategic sourcing may foster greater economy and efficiency. Documented procurement actions of this type (using strategic sourcing, shared services, and other similar procurement arrangements) will meet the competition requirements of this part.
Procurement arrangements using strategic sourcing.(f)  The recipient or subrecipient is encouraged to use excess and surplus Federal property instead of purchasing new equipment and property when it is feasible and reduces project costs.
Use of excess and surplus Federal property.(g)  When practical, the recipient or subrecipient is encouraged to use value engineering clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering means analyzing each contract item or task to ensure its essential function is provided at the overall lowest cost.
Use of value engineering clauses.(h)  The recipient or subrecipient must award contracts only to responsible contractors that possess the ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed contract. The recipient or subrecipient must consider contractor integrity, public policy compliance, proper classification of employees (see the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. 201, chapter 8), past performance record, and financial and technical resources when conducting a procurement transaction. See also § 200.214.
Responsible contractors.(i)  The recipient or subrecipient must maintain records sufficient to detail the history of each procurement transaction. These records must include the rationale for the procurement method, contract type selection, contractor selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.
Procurement records.(j)  (1) The recipient or subrecipient may use a time-and-materials type contract only after a determination that no other contract is suitable and if the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. Time-and-materials type contract means a contract whose cost to a recipient or subrecipient is the sum of:
Time-and-materials type contracts.(i) The actual cost of materials; and
(ii) Direct labor hours charged at fixed hourly rates that reflect wages, general and administrative expenses, and profit.
(2) Because this formula generates an open-ended contract price, a time-and-materials contract provides no positive profit incentive to the contractor for cost control or labor efficiency. Therefore, each contract must set a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. Further, the recipient or subrecipient awarding such a contract must assert a high degree of oversight to obtain reasonable assurance that the contractor is using efficient methods and effective cost controls.
(k)  The recipient or subrecipient is responsible for the settlement of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of its procurement transactions. These issues include, but are not limited to, source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims. These standards do not relieve the recipient or subrecipient of any contractual responsibilities under its contracts. The Federal agency will not substitute its judgment for that of the recipient or subrecipient unless the matter is primarily a Federal concern. The recipient or subrecipient must report violations of law to the Federal, State, or local authority with proper jurisdiction.
Settlement of contractual and administrative issues.(l)  (1) The procurement standards in this subpart do not prohibit recipients or subrecipients from:
Examples of labor and employment practices.(i) Using Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) or similar forms of pre-hire collective bargaining agreements;
(ii) Requiring construction contractors to use hiring preferences or goals for people residing in high-poverty areas, disadvantaged communities as defined by the Justice40 Initiative (see OMB Memorandum M-21-28), or high-unemployment census tracts within a region no smaller than the county where a federally funded construction project is located. The hiring preferences or goals should be consistent with the policies and procedures of the recipient or subrecipient, and must not prohibit interstate hiring;
(iii) Requiring a contractor to use hiring preferences or goals for individuals with barriers to employment (as defined in section 3 of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3102(24)), including women and people from underserved communities as defined by Executive Order 14091;
(iv) Using agreements intended to ensure uninterrupted delivery of services; using agreements intended to ensure community benefits; or
(v) Offering employees of a predecessor contractor rights of first refusal under a new contract.
(2) Recipients and subrecipients may use the practices listed in paragraph (1) if consistent with the U.S. Constitution, applicable Federal statutes and regulations, the objectives and purposes of the applicable Federal financial assistance program, and other requirements of this part.




200.319SECTION1§ 200.319   Competition.(a) All procurement transactions under the Federal award must be conducted in a manner that provides full and open competition and is consistent with the standards of this section and § 200.320.
(b) To ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, or invitations for bids must be excluded from competing on those procurements.
(c) Examples of situations that may restrict competition include, but are not limited to:
(1) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms for them to qualify to do business;
(2) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding;
(3) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between affiliated companies;
(4) Noncompetitive contracts to consultants that are on retainer contracts;
(5) Organizational conflicts of interest;
(6) Specifying only a “brand name” product instead of allowing “an equal” product to be offered and describing the performance or other relevant requirements of the procurement; and
(7) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.
(d) The recipient or subrecipient must have written procedures for procurement transactions. These procedures must ensure that all solicitations:
(1) Are made in accordance with § 200.319(b);
(2) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the property, equipment, or service being procured. The description may include a statement of the qualitative nature of the property, equipment, or service to be procured. When necessary, the description must provide minimum essential characteristics and standards to which the property, equipment, or service must conform. Detailed product specifications should be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to clearly and accurately describe the technical requirements, a “brand name or equivalent” description of features may be used to provide procurement requirements. The specific features of the named brand must be clearly stated; and
(3) Identify any additional requirements which the offerors must fulfill and all other factors that will be used in evaluating bids or proposals.
(e) The recipient or subrecipient must ensure that all prequalified lists of persons, firms, or products used in procurement transactions are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure maximum open competition. When establishing or amending prequalified lists, the recipient or subrecipient must consider objective factors that evaluate price and cost to maximize competition. The recipient or subrecipient must not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation period.
(f) To the extent consistent with established practices and legal requirements applicable to the recipient or subrecipient, this subpart does not prohibit recipients or subrecipients from developing written procedures for procurement transactions that incorporate a scoring mechanism that rewards bidders that commit to specific numbers and types of U.S. jobs, minimum compensation, benefits, on-the-job-training for employees making work products or providing services on a contract, and other worker protections. This subpart also does not prohibit recipients and subrecipients from making inquiries of bidders about these subjects and assessing the responses. Any scoring mechanism must be consistent with the U.S. Constitution, applicable Federal statutes and regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award.
(g) Noncompetitive procurements can only be awarded in accordance with § 200.320(c).






200.320SECTION1§ 200.320   Procurement methods.There are three types of procurement methods described in this section: informal procurement methods (for micro-purchases and simplified acquisitions); formal procurement methods (through sealed bids or proposals); and noncompetitive procurement methods. For any of these methods, the recipient or subrecipient must maintain and use documented procurement procedures, consistent with the standards of this section and §§ 200.317, 200.318, and 200.319.
(a)  These procurement methods expedite the completion of transactions, minimize administrative burdens, and reduce costs. Informal procurement methods may be used when the value of the procurement transaction under the Federal award does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold as defined in § 200.1. Recipients and subrecipients may also establish a lower threshold. Informal procurement methods include:
Informal procurement methods for small purchases.(1) —(i)  The aggregate amount of the procurement transaction does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold defined in § 200.1. To the extent practicable, the recipient or subrecipient should distribute micro-purchases equitably among qualified suppliers.
Micro-purchasesDistribution.(ii)  Micro-purchases may be awarded without soliciting competitive price or rate quotations if the recipient or subrecipient considers the price reasonable based on research, experience, purchase history, or other information; and maintains documents to support its conclusion. Purchase cards may be used as a method of payment for micro-purchases.
Micro-purchase awards.(iii)  The recipient or subrecipient is responsible for determining and documenting an appropriate micro-purchase threshold based on internal controls, an evaluation of risk, and its documented procurement procedures. The micro-purchase threshold used by the recipient or subrecipient must be authorized or not prohibited under State, local, or tribal laws or regulations. The recipient or subrecipient may establish a threshold higher than the Federal threshold established in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1)(iv) and (v) of this section.
Micro-purchase thresholds.(iv)  The recipient or subrecipient may establish a threshold higher than the micro-purchase threshold identified in the FAR in accordance with the requirements of this section. The recipient or subrecipient may self-certify a threshold up to $50,000 on an annual basis and must maintain documentation to be made available to the Federal agency or pass-through entity and auditors in accordance with § 200.334. The self-certification must include a justification, clear identification of the threshold, and supporting documentation of any of the following:
Recipient or subrecipient increase to the micro-purchase threshold up to $50,000.(A) A qualification as a low-risk auditee, in accordance with the criteria in § 200.520 for the most recent audit;
(B) An annual internal institutional risk assessment to identify, mitigate, and manage financial risks; or,
(C) For public institutions, a higher threshold is consistent with State law.
(v)  Micro-purchase thresholds higher than $50,000 must be approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. The recipient or subrecipient must submit a request that includes the requirements in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section. The increased threshold is valid until any factor that was relied on in the establishment and rationale of the threshold changes.
Recipient or subrecipient increase to the micro-purchase threshold over $50,000.(2) —(i)  The aggregate dollar amount of the procurement transaction is higher than the micro-purchase threshold but does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. If simplified acquisition procedures are used, price or rate quotations must be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources. Unless specified by the Federal agency, the recipient or subrecipient may exercise judgment in determining what number is adequate.
Simplified acquisitionsSimplified acquisition procedures.(ii)  The recipient or subrecipient is responsible for determining an appropriate simplified acquisition threshold based on internal controls, an evaluation of risk, and its documented procurement procedures, which may be lower than, but must not exceed, the threshold established in the FAR.
Simplified acquisition thresholds.(b)  Formal procurement methods are required when the value of the procurement transaction under a Federal award exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold of the recipient or subrecipient. Formal procurement methods are competitive and require public notice. The following formal methods of procurement are used for procurement transactions above the simplified acquisition threshold determined by the recipient or subrecipient in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section:
Formal procurement methods.(1)  This is a procurement method in which bids are publicly solicited through an invitation and a firm fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid conforms with all the material terms and conditions of the invitation and is the lowest in price. The sealed bids procurement method is preferred for procuring construction services.
Sealed bids.(i) For sealed bidding to be feasible, the following conditions should be present:
(A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase description is available; (B) Two or more responsible bidders have been identified as willing and able to compete effectively for the business; and
(C) The procurement lends itself to a firm-fixed-price contract, and the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally based on price.
(ii) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:
(A) Bids must be solicited from an adequate number of qualified sources, providing them with sufficient response time prior to the date set for opening the bids. Unless specified by the Federal agency, the recipient or subrecipient may exercise judgment in determining what number is adequate. For local governments, the invitation for bids must be publicly advertised.
(B) The invitation for bids must define the items or services with specific information, including any required specifications, for the bidder to properly respond;
(C) All bids will be opened at the time and place prescribed in the invitation for bids. For local governments, the bids must be opened publicly.
(D) A firm-fixed-price contract is awarded in writing to the lowest responsive bid and responsible bidder. When specified in the invitation for bids, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life-cycle costs must be considered in determining which bid is the lowest. Payment discounts must only be used to determine the low bid when the recipient or subrecipient determines they are a valid factor based on prior experience.
(E) The recipient or subrecipient must document and provide a justification for all bids it rejects.
(2)  This is a procurement method used when conditions are not appropriate for using sealed bids. This procurement method may result in either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement contract. They are awarded in accordance with the following requirements:
Proposals.(i) Requests for proposals require public notice, and all evaluation factors and their relative importance must be identified. Proposals must be solicited from multiple qualified entities. To the maximum extent practicable, any proposals submitted in response to the public notice must be considered.
(ii) The recipient or subrecipient must have written procedures for conducting technical evaluations and making selections.
(iii) Contracts must be awarded to the responsible offeror whose proposal is most advantageous to the recipient or subrecipient considering price and other factors; and
(iv) The recipient or subrecipient may use competitive proposal procedures for qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) professional services whereby the offeror's qualifications are evaluated, and the most qualified offeror is selected, subject to negotiation of fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where the price is not used as a selection factor, can only be used to procure architectural/engineering (A/E) professional services. The method may not be used to purchase other services provided by A/E firms that are a potential source to perform the proposed effort.
(c)  There are specific circumstances in which the recipient or subrecipient may use a noncompetitive procurement method. The noncompetitive procurement method may only be used if one of the following circumstances applies:
Noncompetitive procurement.(1) The aggregate amount of the procurement transaction does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold (see paragraph (a)(1) of this section);
(2) The procurement transaction can only be fulfilled by a single source;
(3) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from providing public notice of a competitive solicitation;
(4) The recipient or subrecipient requests in writing to use a noncompetitive procurement method, and the Federal agency or pass-through entity provides written approval; or
(5) After soliciting several sources, competition is determined inadequate.




200.321SECTION1§ 200.321   Contracting with small businesses, minority businesses, women's business enterprises, veteran-owned businesses, and labor surplus area firms.(a) When possible, the recipient or subrecipient should ensure that small businesses, minority businesses, women's business enterprises, veteran-owned businesses, and labor surplus area firms (See U.S. Department of Labor's list) are considered as set forth below.
(b) Such consideration means:
(1) These business types are included on solicitation lists;
(2) These business types are solicited whenever they are deemed eligible as potential sources;
(3) Dividing procurement transactions into separate procurements to permit maximum participation by these business types;
(4) Establishing delivery schedules (for example, the percentage of an order to be delivered by a given date of each month) that encourage participation by these business types;
(5) Utilizing organizations such as the Small Business Administration and the Minority Business Development Agency of the Department of Commerce; and
(6) Requiring a contractor under a Federal award to apply this section to subcontracts.




200.322SECTION1§ 200.322   Domestic preferences for procurements.(a) The recipient or subrecipient should, to the greatest extent practicable and consistent with law, provide a preference for the purchase, acquisition, or use of goods, products, or materials produced in the United States (including but not limited to iron, aluminum, steel, cement, and other manufactured products). The requirements of this section must be included in all subawards, contracts, and purchase orders under Federal awards.
(b) For purposes of this section:
(1) “Produced in the United States” means, for iron and steel products, that all manufacturing processes, from the initial melting stage through the application of coatings, occurred in the United States.
(2) “Manufactured products” means items and construction materials composed in whole or in part of non-ferrous metals such as aluminum; plastics and polymer-based products such as polyvinyl chloride pipe; aggregates such as concrete; glass, including optical fiber; and lumber.
(c) Federal agencies providing Federal financial assistance for infrastructure projects must implement the Buy America preferences set forth in 2 CFR part 184.




200.323SECTION1§ 200.323   Procurement of recovered materials.(a) A recipient or subrecipient that is a State agency or agency of a political subdivision of a State and its contractors must comply with section 6002 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6962. The requirements of Section 6002 include procuring only items designated in the guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR part 247 that contain the highest percentage of recovered materials practicable, consistent with maintaining a satisfactory level of competition, where the purchase price of the item exceeds $10,000 or the value of the quantity acquired during the preceding fiscal year exceeded $10,000; procuring solid waste management services in a manner that maximizes energy and resource recovery; and establishing an affirmative procurement program for procurement of recovered materials identified in the EPA guidelines.
(b) The recipient or subrecipient should, to the greatest extent practicable and consistent with law, purchase, acquire, or use products and services that can be reused, refurbished, or recycled; contain recycled content, are biobased, or are energy and water efficient; and are sustainable. This may include purchasing compostable items and other products and services that reduce the use of single-use plastic products. See Executive Order 14057, section 101, Policy.




200.324SECTION1§ 200.324   Contract cost and price.(a) The recipient or subrecipient must perform a cost or price analysis for every procurement transaction, including contract modifications, in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold. The method and degree of analysis conducted depend on the facts surrounding the particular procurement transaction. For example, the recipient or subrecipient should consider potential workforce impacts in their analysis if the procurement transaction will displace public sector employees. However, as a starting point, the recipient or subrecipient must make independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals.
(b) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under the Federal award are allowable only to the extent that the costs incurred or cost estimates included in negotiated prices would be allowable for the recipient or subrecipient under subpart E of this part. The recipient or subrecipient may reference its own cost principles as long as they comply with subpart E of this part.
(c) The recipient or subrecipient must not use the “cost plus a percentage of cost” and “percentage of construction costs” methods of contracting.






200.325SECTION1§ 200.325   Federal agency or pass-through entity review.(a) The Federal agency or pass-through entity may review the technical specifications of proposed procurements under the Federal award if the Federal agency or pass-through entity believes the review is needed to ensure that the item or service specified is the one being proposed for acquisition. The recipient or subrecipient must submit the technical specifications of proposed procurements when requested by the Federal agency or pass-through entity. This review should take place prior to the time the specifications are incorporated into a solicitation document. When the recipient or subrecipient desires to accomplish the review after a solicitation has been developed, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may still review the specifications. In those cases, the review should be limited to the technical aspects of the proposed purchase.
(b) When requested, the recipient or subrecipient must provide procurement documents (such as requests for proposals, invitations for bids, or independent cost estimates) to the Federal agency or pass-through entity for pre-procurement review. The Federal agency or pass-through entity may conduct a pre-procurement review when:
(1) The recipient's or subrecipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this part;
(2) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and is to be awarded without competition, or only one bid is expected to be received in response to a solicitation;
(3) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and specifies a “brand name” product;
(4) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, and a sealed bid procurement is to be awarded to an entity other than the apparent low bidder; or
(5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than the simplified acquisition threshold.
(c) The recipient or subrecipient is exempt from the pre-procurement review in paragraph (b) of this section if the Federal agency or pass-through entity determines that its procurement systems comply with the standards of this part.
(1) The recipient or subrecipient may request that the Federal agency or pass-through entity review its procurement system to determine whether it meets these standards for its system to be certified. Generally, these reviews must occur where there is continuous high-dollar funding and third-party contracts are awarded regularly.
(2) The recipient or subrecipient may self-certify its procurement system. However, self-certification does not limit the Federal agency's or pass-through entity's right to review the system. Under a self-certification procedure, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may rely on written assurances from the recipient or subrecipient that it is complying with the standards of this part. The recipient or subrecipient must cite specific policies, procedures, regulations, or standards as complying with these requirements and have its system available for review.




200.326SECTION1§ 200.326   Bonding requirements.The Federal agency or pass-through entity may accept the recipient's or subrecipient's bonding policy and requirements for construction or facility improvement contracts or subcontracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. Before doing so, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must determine that the Federal interest is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements must be as follows:
(a) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The bid guarantee must consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of the bid, execute any required contractual documents within the specified timeframe.
(b) A performance bond on the contractor's part for 100 percent of the contract price. A performance bond is a bond executed in connection with a contract to secure the fulfillment of all the contractor's requirements under a contract.
(c) A payment bond on the contractor's part for 100 percent of the contract price. A payment bond is a bond executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by the law of all persons supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for under a contract.




200.327SECTION1§ 200.327   Contract provisions.The recipient's or subrecipient's contracts must contain the applicable provisions described in Appendix II of this part.


ECFR36520e4111dce32SUBJGRPPerformance and Financial Monitoring and Reporting200.328SECTION1§ 200.328   Financial reporting.(a) The Federal agency must require only OMB-approved government-wide data elements on recipient financial reports. At the time of publication, this consists of the Federal Financial Report (SF-425); however, this also applies to any future OMB-approved government-wide data elements available from the OMB-designated standards lead.
(b) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must collect financial reports no less than annually. The Federal agency or pass-through entity may not collect financial reports more frequently than quarterly unless a specific condition has been implemented in accordance with § 200.208. To the extent practicable, the Federal agency or pass-through entity should collect financial reports in coordination with performance reports.
(c) The recipient or subrecipient must submit financial reports as required by the Federal award. Reports submitted annually by the recipient or subrecipient must be due no later than 90 calendar days after the reporting period. Reports submitted quarterly or semiannually must be due no later than 30 calendar days after the reporting period.
(d) The final financial report submitted by the recipient must be due no later than 120 calendar days after the conclusion of the period of performance. A subrecipient must submit a final financial report to a pass-through entity no later than 90 calendar days after the conclusion of the period of performance. See also § 200.344. The Federal agency or pass-through entity may extend the due date for any financial report with justification from the recipient or subrecipient.




200.329SECTION1§ 200.329   Monitoring and reporting program performance.(a)  The recipient and subrecipient are responsible for the oversight of the Federal award. The recipient and subrecipient must monitor their activities under Federal awards to ensure they are compliant with all requirements and meeting performance expectations. Monitoring by the recipient and subrecipient must cover each program, function, or activity. See also § 200.332.
Monitoring by the recipient and subrecipient.(b)  The Federal agency must use OMB-approved common information collections (for example, Research Performance Progress Reports) when requesting performance reporting information. The Federal agency or pass-through entity may not collect performance reports more frequently than quarterly unless a specific condition has been implemented in accordance with § 200.208. To the extent practicable, the Federal agency or pass-through entity should align the due dates of performance reports and financial reports. When reporting program performance, the recipient or subrecipient must relate financial data and project or program accomplishments to the performance goals and objectives of the Federal award. Also, the recipient or subrecipient must provide cost information to demonstrate cost-effective practices (for example, through unit cost data) when required by the terms and conditions of the Federal award. In some instances (for example, discretionary research awards), this may be limited to the requirement to submit technical performance reports. Reporting requirements must clearly indicate a standard against which the recipient's or subrecipient's performance can be measured. Reporting requirements should not solicit information from the recipient or subrecipient that is not necessary for the effective monitoring or evaluation of the Federal award. Federal agencies should consult monitoring framework documents such as the agency's Evaluation Plan to make that determination. As noted in OMB Circular A-11, Part 6, Section 280, measures of customer experience are of co-equal importance as traditional measures of financial and operational performance.
Reporting program performance.(c)  (1) The recipient or subrecipient must submit performance reports as required by the Federal award. Intervals must be no less frequent than annually nor more frequent than quarterly except if specific conditions are applied (See § 200.208). Reports submitted annually by the recipient or subrecipient must be due no later than 90 calendar days after the reporting period. Reports submitted quarterly or semiannually must be due no later than 30 calendar days after the reporting period. Alternatively, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple-year Federal awards. The final performance report submitted by the recipient must be due no later than 120 calendar days after the period of performance. A subrecipient must submit a final performance report to a pass-through entity no later than 90 calendar days after the conclusion of the period of performance. See also § 200.344. The Federal agency or pass-through entity may extend the due date for any performance report with justification from the recipient or subrecipient.
Submitting performance reports.(2) As applicable, performance reports should contain information on the following:
(i) A comparison of accomplishments to the objectives of the Federal award established for the reporting period (for example, comparing costs to units of accomplishment). Where performance trend data and analysis would be informative to the Federal agency program, the Federal agency should include this as a performance reporting requirement.
(ii) Explanations on why established goals or objectives were not met; and
(iii) Additional information, analysis, and explanation of cost overruns or higher-than-expected unit costs.
(d)  Federal agencies or pass-through entities rely on on-site technical inspections and certified percentage of completion data to monitor progress under Federal awards for construction. Therefore, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may require additional performance reports when necessary to ensure the goals and objectives of Federal awards are met.
Construction performance reports.(e)  When a significant development that could impact the Federal award occurs between performance reporting due dates, the recipient or subrecipient must notify the Federal agency or pass-through entity. Significant developments include events that enable meeting milestones and objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or that produce different beneficial results than originally planned. Significant developments also include problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will impact the recipient's or subrecipient's ability to meet milestones or the objectives of the Federal award. When significant developments occur that negatively impact the Federal Award, the recipient or subrecipient must include information on their plan for corrective action and any assistance needed to resolve the situation.
Significant developments.(f)  The Federal agency or pass-through entity may conduct in-person or virtual site visits as warranted.
Site visits.(g)  The Federal agency may waive any performance report that is not necessary to ensure the goals and objectives of the Federal award are being achieved.




Performance report requirement waiver.200.330SECTION1§ 200.330   Reporting on real property.The Federal agency or pass-through entity must require the recipient or subrecipient to submit reports on the status of real property in which the Federal Government retains an interest. Such reports must be submitted at least annually. In instances where the Federal Government's interest in the real property extends for 15 years or more, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may require the recipient or subrecipient to report at various multi-year frequencies. Reports submitted at multi-year frequencies may not exceed a five-year reporting period. The Federal agency must only require OMB-approved government-wide data elements on recipient real property reports.


ECFR031321e29ac5bbdSUBJGRPSubrecipient Monitoring and Management200.331SECTION1§ 200.331   Subrecipient and contractor determinations.An entity may concurrently receive Federal awards as a recipient, a subrecipient, and a contractor. The pass-through entity is responsible for making case-by-case determinations to determine whether the entity receiving Federal funds is a subrecipient or a contractor. The Federal agency may require the pass-through entity to comply with additional guidance to make these determinations, provided such guidance does not conflict with this section. The Federal agency does not have a direct legal relationship with subrecipients or contractors of any tier; however, the Federal agency is responsible for monitoring the pass-through entity's oversight of first-tier subrecipients. All of the characteristics listed below may not be present in all cases, and some characteristics from both categories may be present at the same time. No single factor or any combination of factors is necessarily determinative. The pass-through entity must use judgment in classifying each agreement as a subaward or a procurement contract. In making this determination, the substance of the relationship is more important than the form of the agreement.
(a)  A subaward is for the purpose of carrying out a portion of the Federal award and creates a Federal financial assistance relationship with a subrecipient. See the definition of  in § 200.1. Characteristics that support the classification of the entity as a subrecipient include, but are not limited to, when the entity:
Subrecipients.Subaward(1) Determines who is eligible to receive what Federal assistance;
(2) Has its performance measured in relation to whether the objectives of a Federal program were met;
(3) Has responsibility for programmatic decision-making;
(4) Is responsible for adherence to applicable Federal program requirements specified in the Federal award; and
(5) Implements a program for a public purpose specified in authorizing statute, as opposed to providing goods or services for the benefit of the pass-through entity.
(b)  A contract is for the purpose of obtaining goods and services for the recipient's or subrecipient's use and creates a procurement relationship with a contractor. See the definition of  in § 200.1. Characteristics that support a procurement relationship between the recipient or subrecipient and a contractor include, but are not limited to, when the contractor:
Contractors.contract(1) Provides the goods and services within normal business operations;
(2) Provides similar goods or services to many different purchasers;
(3) Normally operates in a competitive environment;
(4) Provides goods or services that are ancillary to the implementation of a Federal program; and
(5) Is not subject to compliance requirements of a Federal program as a result of the agreement. However, similar requirements may apply for other reasons.






200.332SECTION1§ 200.332   Requirements for pass-through entities.A pass-through entity must:
(a) Verify that the subrecipient is not excluded or disqualified in accordance with § 180.300. Verification methods are provided in § 180.300, which include confirming in  that a potential subrecipient is not suspended, debarred, or otherwise excluded from receiving Federal funds.
SAM.gov(b) Ensure that every subaward is clearly identified to the subrecipient as a subaward and includes the information provided below. A pass-through entity must provide the best available information when some of the information below is unavailable. A pass-through entity must provide the unavailable information when it is obtained. Required information includes:
(1) Federal award identification.
(i) Subrecipient's name (must match the name associated with its unique entity identifier);
(ii) Subrecipient's unique entity identifier;
(iii) Federal Award Identification Number (FAIN);
(iv) Federal Award Date;
(v) Subaward Period of Performance Start and End Date;
(vi) Subaward Budget Period Start and End Date;
(vii) Amount of Federal Funds Obligated in the subaward;
(viii) Total Amount of Federal Funds Obligated to the subrecipient by the pass-through entity, including the current financial obligation;
(ix) Total Amount of the Federal Award committed to the subrecipient by the pass-through entity;
(x) Federal award project description, as required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA);
(xi) Name of the Federal agency, pass-through entity, and contact information for awarding official of the pass-through entity;
(xii) Assistance Listings title and number; the pass-through entity must identify the dollar amount made available under each Federal award and the Assistance Listings Number at the time of disbursement;
(xiii) Identification of whether the Federal award is for research and development; and
(xiv) Indirect cost rate for the Federal award (including if the de minimis rate is used in accordance with § 200.414).
(2) All requirements of the subaward, including requirements imposed by Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award;
(3) Any additional requirements that the pass-through entity imposes on the subrecipient for the pass-through entity to meet its responsibilities under the Federal award. This includes information and certifications (see § 200.415) required for submitting financial and performance reports that the pass-through entity must provide to the Federal agency;
(4) Indirect cost rate:
(i) An approved indirect cost rate negotiated between the subrecipient and the Federal Government. If no approved rate exists, a pass-through entity must determine the appropriate rate in collaboration with the subrecipient. The indirect cost rate may be either:
(A) An indirect cost rate negotiated between the pass-through entity and the subrecipient. These rates may be based on a prior negotiated rate between a different pass-through entity and the subrecipient, in which case the pass-through entity is not required to collect information justifying the rate but may elect to do so; or
(B) The de minimis indirect cost rate.
(ii) The pass-through entity must not require the use of the de minimis indirect cost rate if the subrecipient has an approved indirect cost rate negotiated with the Federal Government. Subrecipients may elect to use the cost allocation method to account for indirect costs in accordance with § 200.405(d).
(5) A requirement that the subrecipient permit the pass-through entity and auditors to access the subrecipient's records and financial statements for the pass-through entity to fulfill its monitoring requirements; and
(6) Appropriate terms and conditions concerning the closeout of the subaward.
(c) Evaluate each subrecipient's fraud risk and risk of noncompliance with a subaward to determine the appropriate subrecipient monitoring described in paragraph (f) of this section. When evaluating a subrecipient's risk, a pass-through entity should consider the following:
(1) The subrecipient's prior experience with the same or similar subawards;
(2) The results of previous audits. This includes considering whether or not the subrecipient receives a Single Audit in accordance with subpart F and the extent to which the same or similar subawards have been audited as a major program;
(3) Whether the subrecipient has new personnel or new or substantially changed systems; and
(4) The extent and results of any Federal agency monitoring (for example, if the subrecipient also receives Federal awards directly from the Federal agency).
(d) If appropriate, consider implementing specific conditions in a subaward as described in § 200.208 and notify the Federal agency of the specific conditions.
(e) Monitor the activities of a subrecipient as necessary to ensure that the subrecipient complies with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the subaward. The pass-through entity is responsible for monitoring the overall performance of a subrecipient to ensure that the goals and objectives of the subaward are achieved. In monitoring a subrecipient, a pass-through entity must:
(1) Review financial and performance reports.
(2) Ensure that the subrecipient takes corrective action on all significant developments that negatively affect the subaward. Significant developments include Single Audit findings related to the subaward, other audit findings, site visits, and written notifications from a subrecipient of adverse conditions which will impact their ability to meet the milestones or the objectives of a subaward. When significant developments negatively impact the subaward, a subrecipient must provide the pass-through entity with information on their plan for corrective action and any assistance needed to resolve the situation.
(3) Issue a management decision for audit findings pertaining only to the Federal award provided to the subrecipient from the pass-through entity as required by § 200.521.
(4) Resolve audit findings specifically related to the subaward. However, the pass-through entity is not responsible for resolving cross-cutting audit findings that apply to the subaward and other Federal awards or subawards. If a subrecipient has a current Single Audit report and has not been excluded from receiving Federal funding (meaning, has not been debarred or suspended), the pass-through entity may rely on the subrecipient's cognizant agency for audit or oversight agency for audit to perform audit follow-up and make management decisions related to cross-cutting audit findings in accordance with section § 200.513(a)(4)(viii). Such reliance does not eliminate the responsibility of the pass-through entity to issue subawards that conform to agency and award-specific requirements, to manage risk through ongoing subaward monitoring, and to monitor the status of the findings that are specifically related to the subaward.
(f) Depending upon the pass-through entity's assessment of the risk posed by the subrecipient (as described in paragraph (c) of this section), the following monitoring tools may be useful for the pass-through entity to ensure proper accountability and compliance with program requirements and achievement of performance goals:
(1) Providing subrecipients with training and technical assistance on program-related matters;
(2) Performing site visits to review the subrecipient's program operations; and
(3) Arranging for agreed-upon-procedures engagements as described in § 200.425.
(g) Verify that a subrecipient is audited as required by subpart F of this part.
(h) Consider whether the results of a subrecipient's audit, site visits, or other monitoring necessitate adjustments to the pass-through entity's records.
(i) Consider taking enforcement action against noncompliant subrecipients as described in § 200.339 and in program regulations.




200.333SECTION1§ 200.333   Fixed amount subawards.With prior written approval from the Federal agency, the recipient may provide subawards based on fixed amounts up to $500,000. Fixed amount subawards must meet the requirements of § 200.201.


ECFR4acc10e7e3b676fSUBJGRPRecord Retention and Access200.334SECTION1§ 200.334   Record retention requirements.The recipient and subrecipient must retain all Federal award records for three years from the date of submission of their final financial report. For awards that are renewed quarterly or annually, the recipient and subrecipient must retain records for three years from the date of submission of their quarterly or annual financial report, respectively. Records to be retained include but are not limited to, financial records, supporting documentation, and statistical records. Federal agencies or pass-through entities may not impose any other record retention requirements except for the following:
(a) The records must be retained until all litigation, claims, or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken if any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the three-year period.
(b) When the recipient or subrecipient is notified in writing by the Federal agency or pass-through entity, cognizant agency for audit, oversight agency for audit, or cognizant agency for indirect costs to extend the retention period.
(c) The records for property and equipment acquired with the support of Federal funds must be retained for three years after final disposition.
(d) The three-year retention requirement does not apply to the recipient or subrecipient when records are transferred to or maintained by the Federal agency.
(e) The records for program income earned after the period of performance must be retained for three years from the end of the recipient's or subrecipient's fiscal year in which the program income is earned. This only applies if the Federal agency or pass-through entity requires the recipient or subrecipient to report on program income earned after the period of performance in the terms and conditions of the Federal award.
(f) The records for indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates) must be retained according to the applicable option below:
(1)  When a proposal, plan, or other computation must be submitted to the Federal Government to form the basis for negotiation of an indirect cost rate (or other standard rates), then the three-year retention period for its supporting records starts from the date of submission.
If submitted for negotiation.(2)  When a proposal, plan, or other computation is not required to be submitted to the Federal Government to form the basis for negotiation of an indirect cost rate (or other standard rates), then the three-year retention period for its supporting records starts from the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.




If not submitted for negotiation.200.335SECTION1§ 200.335   Requests for transfer of records.The Federal agency must request the transfer of records to its custody from the recipient or subrecipient when it determines that the records possess long-term retention value. However, the Federal agency may arrange for the recipient or subrecipient to retain the records that have long-term retention value so long as they are continuously available to the Federal Government.




200.336SECTION1§ 200.336   Methods for collection, transmission, and storage of information.When practicable, the Federal agency or pass-through entity and the recipient or subrecipient must collect, transmit, and store Federal award information in open and machine-readable formats. A machine-readable format is a format in a standard computer language (not English text) that can be read automatically by a computer system. Upon request, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must always provide or accept paper versions of Federal award information to and from the recipient or subrecipient. The Federal agency or pass-through entity must not require additional copies of Federal award information submitted in paper versions. The recipient or subrecipient does not need to create and retain paper copies when original records are electronic and cannot be altered. In addition, the recipient or subrecipient may substitute electronic versions of original paper records through duplication or other forms of electronic conversion, provided that the procedures are subject to periodic quality control reviews. Quality control reviews must ensure that electronic conversion procedures provide safeguards against the alteration of records and assurance that records remain in a format that is readable by a computer system.




200.337SECTION1§ 200.337   Access to records.(a)  The Federal agency or pass-through entity, Inspectors General, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their authorized representatives must have the right of access to any records of the recipient or subrecipient pertinent to the Federal award to perform audits, execute site visits, or for any other official use. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to the recipient's or subrecipient's personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents or the Federal award in general.
Records of recipients and subrecipients.(b)  The recipient or subrecipient and Federal agency or pass-through entity must take measures to protect the name of victims of a crime when access to the victim's name is necessary. Only under extraordinary and rare circumstances would such access include a review of the true name of victims of a crime. Routine monitoring cannot be considered extraordinary and rare circumstances that would necessitate access to this information. Any such access, other than under a court order or subpoena pursuant to a bona fide confidential investigation, must be approved by the head or delegate of the Federal agency.
Extraordinary and rare circumstances.(c)  The Federal agency's or pass-through entity's rights of access are not limited to the required retention period of this part but last as long as the records are retained. Federal agencies or pass-through entities must not impose any other access requirements upon recipients and subrecipients.




Expiration of right of access.200.338SECTION1§ 200.338   Restrictions on public access to records.Federal agencies may not place restrictions on the recipient or subrecipient that limit public access to the records of the recipient or subrecipient pertinent to a Federal award, except for protected personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive information when the Federal agency can demonstrate that such records will be kept confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or controlled unclassified information pursuant to Executive Order 13556 if the records had belonged to the Federal agency. The Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) (FOIA) does not apply to records that remain under the recipient's or subrecipient's control except as required by § 200.315. Unless required by Federal, State, local, or tribal law, recipients and subrecipients are not required to permit public access to their records. The recipient's or subrecipient's records provided to a Federal agency generally will be subject to FOIA and applicable exemptions.


ECFR86b76dde0e1e9dcSUBJGRPRemedies for Noncompliance200.339SECTION1§ 200.339   Remedies for noncompliance.The Federal agency or pass-through entity may implement specific conditions if the recipient or subrecipient fails to comply with the U.S. Constitution, Federal statutes, regulations, or terms and conditions of the Federal award. See § 200.208 for additional information on specific conditions. When the Federal agency or pass-through entity determines that noncompliance cannot be remedied by imposing specific conditions, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may take one or more of the following actions:
(a) Temporarily withhold payments until the recipient or subrecipient takes corrective action.
(b) Disallow costs for all or part of the activity associated with the noncompliance of the recipient or subrecipient.
(c) Suspend or terminate the Federal award in part or in its entirety.
(d) Initiate suspension or debarment proceedings as authorized in 2 CFR part 180 and the Federal agency's regulations, or for pass-through entities, recommend suspension or debarment proceedings be initiated by the Federal agency.
(e) Withhold further Federal funds (new awards or continuation funding) for the project or program.
(f) Pursue other legally available remedies.




200.340SECTION1§ 200.340   Termination.(a) The Federal award may be terminated in part or its entirety as follows:
(1) By the Federal agency or pass-through entity if the recipient or subrecipient fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award;
(2) By the Federal agency or pass-through entity with the consent of the recipient or subrecipient, in which case the two parties must agree upon the termination conditions. These conditions include the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated;
(3) By the recipient or subrecipient upon sending the Federal agency or pass-through entity a written notification of the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However, if the Federal agency or pass-through entity determines that the remaining portion of the Federal award will not accomplish the purposes for which the Federal award was made, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may terminate the Federal award in its entirety; or
(4) By the Federal agency or pass-through entity pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal award, including, to the extent authorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.
(b) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must clearly and unambiguously specify all termination provisions in the terms and conditions of the Federal award.
(c) When the Federal agency terminates the Federal award prior to the end of the period of performance due to the recipient's material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award, the Federal agency must report the termination in . A Federal agency must use the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to enter information in .
SAM.govSAM.gov(1) The information required under paragraph (c) of this section is not to be reported in  until the recipient has either:
SAM.gov(i) Exhausted its opportunities to object or challenge the decision (see § 200.342); or
(ii) Has not, within 30 calendar days after being notified of the termination, informed the Federal agency that it intends to appeal the decision to terminate.
(2) If a Federal agency, after entering information about a termination in , subsequently:
SAM.gov(i) Learns that any of that information is erroneous, the Federal agency must correct the information in the system within three business days;
(ii) Obtains an update to that information that could be helpful to other Federal agencies, the Federal agency is strongly encouraged to amend the information in the system to incorporate the update in a timely way.
(3) The Federal agency must not post any information that will be made publicly available in the non-public segment of  that is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). When the recipient asserts within seven calendar days to the Federal agency which posted the information that a disclosure exemption under FOIA covers some of the information made publicly available, the Federal agency that posted the information must remove the posting within seven calendar days of receiving the assertion. Before reposting the releasable information, the Federal agency must resolve the issue in accordance with the agency's FOIA procedures.
SAM.gov(d) When the Federal award is terminated in part or its entirety, the Federal agency or pass-through entity and recipient or subrecipient remain responsible for compliance with the requirements in §§ 200.344 and 200.345.




200.341SECTION1§ 200.341   Notification of termination requirement.(a) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must provide written notice of termination to the recipient or subrecipient. The written notice of termination should include the reasons for termination, the effective date, and the portion of the Federal award to be terminated, if applicable.
(b) If the Federal award is terminated for the recipient's material failure to comply with a Federal award, the notification must state the following:
(1) The termination decision will be reported in ;
SAM.gov(2) The information will be available in  for five years from the date of the termination and then archived;
SAM.gov(3) Federal agencies that consider making a Federal award to the recipient during the five year period must consider this information in judging whether the recipient is qualified to receive the Federal award when the Federal share of the Federal award is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold over the period of performance;
(4) The recipient may comment on any information in  about the recipient for future consideration by Federal agencies. The recipient may submit comments in .
SAM.govSAM.gov(5) Federal agencies should consider the recipient's comments when determining whether the recipient is qualified for a Federal award.
(c) Upon termination of the Federal award, the Federal agency must provide the information required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA) to  In addition, the Federal agency must update or notify any other relevant government-wide systems or entities of any indications of poor performance as required by 41 U.S.C. 2313 and 31 U.S.C. 3321.




USAspending.gov.200.342SECTION1§ 200.342   Opportunities to object, hearings, and appeals.The Federal agency must maintain written procedures for processing objections, hearings, and appeals. Upon initiating a remedy for noncompliance (for example, disallowed costs, a corrective action plan, or termination), the Federal agency must provide the recipient with an opportunity to object and provide information challenging the action. The Federal agency or pass-through entity must comply with any requirements for hearings, appeals, or other administrative proceedings to which the recipient or subrecipient is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.




200.343SECTION1§ 200.343   Effects of suspension and termination.Costs to the recipient or subrecipient resulting from financial obligations incurred by the recipient or subrecipient during a suspension or after the termination of a Federal award are not allowable unless the Federal agency or pass-through entity expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. However, costs during suspension or after termination are allowable if:
(a) The costs result from financial obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient or subrecipient before the effective date of suspension or termination, and not in anticipation of it; and
(b) The costs would be allowable if the Federal award was not suspended or expired normally at the end of the period of performance in which the termination takes effect.




ECFR682eb6fbfabcde2SUBJGRPCloseout200.344SECTION1§ 200.344   Closeout.(a) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must close out the Federal award when it determines that all administrative actions and required work of the Federal award have been completed. When the recipient or subrecipient fails to complete the necessary administrative actions or the required work for an award, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must proceed with closeout based on the information available. This section specifies the administrative actions required at the end of the period of performance.
(b) A recipient must submit all reports (financial, performance, and other reports required by the Federal award) no later than 120 calendar days after the conclusion of the period of performance. A subrecipient must submit all reports (financial, performance, and other reports required by a subaward) to the pass-through entity no later than 90 calendar days after the conclusion of the period of performance of the subaward (or an earlier date as agreed upon by the pass-through entity and subrecipient). When justified, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may approve extensions for the recipient or subrecipient. When the recipient does not have a final indirect cost rate covering the period of performance, a final financial report must still be submitted to fulfill the requirements of this section. The recipient must submit a revised final financial report when all applicable indirect cost rates have been finalized.
(c) The recipient must liquidate all financial obligations incurred under the Federal award no later than 120 calendar days after the conclusion of the period of performance. A subrecipient must liquidate all financial obligations incurred under a subaward no later than 90 calendar days after the conclusion of the period of performance of the subaward (or an earlier date as agreed upon by the pass-through entity and subrecipient). When justified, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may approve extensions for the recipient or subrecipient.
(d) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must not delay payments to the recipient or subrecipient for costs meeting the requirements of subpart E of this part.
(e) The recipient or subrecipient must promptly refund any unobligated funds that the Federal agency or pass-through entity paid and that are not authorized to be retained. See OMB Circular A-129 and § 200.346.
(f) The Federal agency or pass-through entity must make all necessary adjustments to the Federal share of costs after closeout reports are received (for example, to reflect the disallowance of any costs or the deobligation of an unliquidated balance).
(g) The recipient or subrecipient must account for any property acquired with Federal funds or received from the Federal Government in accordance with §§ 200.310 through 200.316 and 200.330.
(h) The Federal agency must make every effort to complete all closeout actions no later than one year after the end of the period of performance. If the indirect cost rate has not been finalized and would delay closeout, the Federal agency is authorized to mutually agree with the recipient to close an award using the current or most recently negotiated rate. However, the recipient is not required to agree to a final rate for a Federal award for the purpose of prompt closeout.
(i) If the recipient does not comply with the requirements of this section, including submitting all final reports, the Federal agency must report the recipient's material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award in . A Federal agency must use the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to enter or amend information in . Federal agencies may also pursue other enforcement actions as appropriate. See § 200.339.


SAM.govSAM.govECFRbceb211a19344ceSUBJGRPPost-Closeout Adjustments and Continuing Responsibilities200.345SECTION1§ 200.345   Post-closeout adjustments and continuing responsibilities.(a) The closeout of the Federal award does not affect any of the following:
(1) The right of the Federal agency or pass-through entity to disallow costs and recover funds on the basis of a later audit or review. However, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must make determinations to disallow costs and notify the recipient or subrecipient within the record retention period.
(2) The recipient's or subrecipient's requirement to return funds or right to receive any remaining and available funds as a result of refunds, corrections, final indirect cost rate adjustments (unless the Federal award in closed in accordance with § 200.344(h)), or other transactions.
(3) The ability of the Federal agency or pass-through entity to make financial adjustments to a previously closed Federal award, such as resolving indirect cost payments and making final payments.
(4) Audit requirements in subpart F of this part.
(5) Property management and disposition requirements in §§ 200.310 through 200.316.
(6) Records retention as required in §§ 200.334 through 200.337.
(b) After the closeout of the Federal award, a relationship created under the Federal award may be modified or ended in whole or in part. This may only be done with the consent of the awarding Federal agency or pass-through entity and the recipient or subrecipient, provided the responsibilities of the recipient or subrecipient referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, including those for property management as applicable, are considered and provisions are made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient or subrecipient, as appropriate.


ECFR1b58ad86a04a1d3SUBJGRPCollection of Amounts Due200.346SECTION1§ 200.346   Collection of amounts due.Any Federal funds paid to the recipient or subrecipient in excess of the amount that the recipient or subrecipient is determined to be entitled to under the Federal award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. The Federal agency must collect all debts arising out of its Federal awards in accordance with the Standards for the Administrative Collection of Claims (31 CFR part 901).


ESUBPARTSubpart E—Cost PrinciplesECFR1f52baf5ea70fffSUBJGRPGeneral Provisions200.400SECTION1§ 200.400   Policy guide.The application of these cost principles is based on the fundamental premises that:
(a) The recipient and subrecipient are responsible for the efficient and effective administration of the Federal award through sound management practices.
(b) The recipient and subrecipient are responsible for administering Federal funds in a manner consistent with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award.
(c) The recipient and subrecipient, in recognition of their unique combination of staff, facilities, and experience, are responsible for employing organization and management techniques necessary to ensure the proper and efficient administration of the Federal award.
(d) The accounting practices of the recipient and subrecipient must be consistent with these cost principles and support the accumulation of costs as required by these cost principles, including maintaining adequate documentation to support costs charged to the Federal award.
(e) When reviewing, negotiating, and approving cost allocation plans or indirect cost proposals, the cognizant agency for indirect costs should ensure that the recipient consistently applies these cost principles. Where wide variations exist in the treatment of a given cost item by the recipient, the reasonableness and equity of such treatments should be fully considered. See the definition of  in § 200.1.
indirect costs(f) For recipients and subrecipients that educate and engage students in research, the dual role of students as both trainees and employees (including pre- and post-doctoral staff) contributing to the completion of Federal awards for research must be recognized in the application of these principles.
(g) The recipient or subrecipient must not earn or keep any profit resulting from Federal financial assistance unless explicitly authorized by the terms and conditions of the Federal award. See also § 200.307. When the required activities of a fixed amount award were completed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award, the unexpended funds retained by the recipient or subrecipient are not considered profit.




200.401SECTION1§ 200.401   Application.(a)  The recipient and subrecipient must apply these principles in determining allowable costs under Federal awards. The recipient and subrecipient must also use these principles as a guide in pricing fixed-price contracts and subcontracts when costs are used in determining the appropriate price. These cost principles do not apply to:
General.(1) Arrangements under which Federal financing is in the form of loans, scholarships, fellowships, traineeships, or other fixed amounts based on items such as education allowance or published tuition rates and fees.
(2) Capitation awards based on case counts or the number of beneficiaries.
(3) Fixed amount awards, except as provided in § 200.101(b). See also § 200.201.
(4) Federal awards to hospitals (see Appendix IX of this part).
(5) Food commodities provided through grants and cooperative agreements.
(6) Other awards under which the recipient or subrecipient is not required to account for actual costs incurred.
(b)  A Federal contract awarded to a recipient is subject to the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). It must incorporate the applicable CAS requirements per 48 CFR Chapter 99 and 48 CFR part 30 (FAR Part 30). With respect to the allocation of costs, the Cost Accounting Standards at 48 CFR parts 9904 or 9905 take precedence over the cost principles in subpart E. When a contract with a recipient is subject to full CAS coverage, the allowability of certain costs under the cost principles will be affected by the allocation provisions of the Cost Accounting Standards (for example, CAS 414—48 CFR 9904.414—Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Facilities Capital, and CAS 417—48 CFR 9904.417—Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Capital Assets Under Construction, apply instead of the allowability provisions of § 200.449). For example, the allowability of costs in CAS-covered contracts is determined first by the allocation provisions of the Cost Accounting Standards rather than the allowability provisions in § 200.449 (unless the CAS does not address the specific costs). In complying with those requirements, the recipient's application of cost accounting practices for estimating, accumulating, and reporting costs for Federal awards and CAS-covered contracts must be consistent with 48 CFR. The recipient only needs to maintain one set of accounting records supporting the allocation of costs if the recipient administers both Federal awards and CAS-covered contracts.
Federal contract.(c)  Some nonprofit organizations, because of their size and nature of operations, can be considered to be similar to for-profit organizations in terms of the applicability of cost principles. These nonprofit organizations must operate under Federal cost principles that apply to for-profit organizations located at 48 CFR 31.2. Appendix VIII contains a list of these nonprofit organizations. Other organizations may be added to this list if approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.


Exemptions.ECFRea20080eff2ea53SUBJGRPBasic Considerations200.402SECTION1§ 200.402   Composition of costs.The total cost of a Federal award is the sum of the allowable direct and allocable indirect costs minus any applicable credits




200.403SECTION1§ 200.403   Factors affecting allowability of costs.Except where otherwise authorized by statute, costs must meet the following criteria to be allowable under Federal awards:
(a) Be necessary and reasonable for the performance of the Federal award and be allocable thereto under these principles.
(b) Conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in these principles or in the Federal award as to types or amount of cost items.
(c) Be consistent with policies and procedures that apply uniformly to both federally financed and other activities of the recipient or subrecipient.
(d) Be accorded consistent treatment. For example, a cost must not be assigned to a Federal award as a direct cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances has been allocated to the Federal award as an indirect cost.
(e) Be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), except, for State and local governments and Indian Tribes only, as otherwise provided for in this part.
(f) Not be included as a cost or used to meet cost sharing requirements of any other federally-financed program in either the current or a prior period. See § 200.306(b).
(g) Be adequately documented. See §§ 200.300 through 200.309.
(h) Administrative closeout costs may be incurred until the due date of the final report(s). If incurred, these costs must be liquidated prior to the due date of the final report(s) and charged to the final budget period of the award unless otherwise specified by the Federal agency. All other costs must be incurred during the approved budget period. At its discretion, the Federal agency is authorized to waive prior written approvals to carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent budget periods. See § 200.308(g)(3).




200.404SECTION1§ 200.404   Reasonable costs.A cost is reasonable if it does not exceed an amount that a prudent person would incur under the circumstances prevailing when the decision was made to incur the cost. In determining the reasonableness of a given cost, consideration must be given to the following:
(a) Whether the cost is generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the recipient's or subrecipient's operation or the proper and efficient performance of the Federal award;
(b) The restraints or requirements imposed by such factors as sound business practices; arm's-length bargaining; Federal, State, local, tribal, and other laws and regulations; and terms and conditions of the Federal award;
(c) Market prices for comparable costs for the geographic area;
(d) Whether the individuals concerned acted with prudence in the circumstances considering their responsibilities to the recipient or subrecipient, its employees, its students or membership (if applicable), the public at large, and the Federal Government; and
(e) Whether the cost represents a deviation from the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policies and procedures for incurring costs.




200.405SECTION1§ 200.405   Allocable costs.(a)  A cost is allocable to a Federal award or other cost objective if the cost is assignable to that Federal award or other cost objective in accordance with the relative benefits received. This standard is met if the cost satisfies any of the following criteria:
Allocable costs in general.(1) Is incurred specifically for the Federal award;
(2) Benefits both the Federal award and other work of the recipient or subrecipient and can be distributed in proportions that may be approximated using reasonable methods; or
(3) Is necessary to the overall operation of the recipient or subrecipient and is assignable in part to the Federal award in accordance with these cost principles.
(b)  All activities which benefit from the recipient's or subrecipient's indirect cost, including unallowable activities and donated services by the recipient or subrecipient or third parties, will receive an appropriate allocation of indirect costs.
Allocation of indirect costs.(c)  A cost allocable to a particular Federal award may not be charged to other Federal awards (for example, to overcome fund deficiencies or to avoid restrictions imposed by Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal awards). However, this prohibition would not preclude the recipient or subrecipient from shifting costs that are allowable under two or more Federal awards in accordance with existing Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal awards.
Limitation on charging certain allocable costs to other Federal awards.(d)  If a cost benefits two or more projects or activities in proportions that can be determined without undue effort or cost, the cost must be allocated to the projects based on the proportional benefit However, when those proportions cannot be determined because of the interrelationship of the work involved, then, notwithstanding paragraph (c), the costs may be allocated or transferred to benefitted projects on any reasonable documented basis. Where the purchase of equipment or other capital asset is specifically authorized under a Federal award, the costs are assignable to the Federal award regardless of the use that may be made of the equipment or other capital asset involved, when no longer needed for the purpose for which it was originally required. See also §§ 200.310 through 200.316 and 200.439.
Direct cost allocation principles.(e)  If a contract is subject to CAS, costs must be allocated to that contract according to the Cost Accounting Standards, which take precedence over the allocation provisions in this part.




Costs of contracts subject to CAS.200.406SECTION1§ 200.406   Applicable credits.(a) Applicable credits refer to transactions that offset or reduce direct or indirect costs allocable to a Federal award. Examples of such transactions are purchase discounts, rebates or allowances, recoveries or indemnities on losses, insurance refunds or rebates, and adjustments of overpayments or erroneous charges. To the extent that such credits accruing to or received by the recipient or subrecipient relate to allowable costs, they must be credited to the Federal award either as a cost reduction or cash refund, as appropriate.
(b) In some instances, the amounts received from the Federal Government to finance activities or service operations of the recipient or subrecipient should be treated as applicable credits. Specifically, the concept of netting such credit items (including any amounts used to meet cost sharing requirements) must be recognized in determining the rates or amounts to be charged to the Federal award. See §§ 200.436 and 200.468 for potential application areas.


200.407SECTION1§ 200.407   Prior written approval (prior approval).The reasonableness and allocability of certain costs under Federal awards may be difficult to determine. To avoid subsequent disallowance or dispute based on unreasonableness or nonallocability, the recipient may seek the prior written approval of the Federal agency (or, for indirect costs, the cognizant agency for indirect costs) before incurring the cost. The absence of prior written approval on any element of cost will not, in itself, affect the reasonableness or allocability of that cost unless prior approval is specifically required for allowability as described under certain circumstances in the following sections:
(a) Section 200.306 Cost sharing;
(b) Section 200.307 Program income;
(c) Section 200.308 Revision of budget and program plans;
(d) Section 200.333 Fixed amount subawards;
(e) Section 200.430 Compensation—personal services, paragraph (h);
(f) Section 200.431 Compensation—fringe benefits;
(g) Section 200.439 Equipment and other capital expenditures;
(h) Section 200.440 Exchange rates;
(i) Section 200.441 Fines, penalties, damages and other settlements;
(j) Section 200.442 Fund raising and investment management costs;
(k) Section 200.445 Goods or services for personal use;

200.408SECTION1§ 200.408   Limitation on allowance of costs.Statutory requirements may limit the allowability of costs. Any costs that exceed the maximum amount allowed by statute may not be charged to the Federal award. Only the amount allowable by statute may be charged to the Federal award.




200.409SECTION1§ 200.409   Special considerations.Other sections in this part describe special considerations and requirements applicable to states, local governments, Indian Tribes, and IHEs. In addition, certain provisions among the items of cost in this subpart are only applicable to certain types of recipients and subrecipients, as specified in the following sections:
(a) Direct and Indirect Costs (§§ 200.412-200.415);
(b) Special Considerations for States, Local Governments and Indian Tribes (§§ 200.416 and 200.417); and
(c) Special Considerations for Institutions of Higher Education (§§ 200.418 and 200.419).




200.410SECTION1§ 200.410   Collection of unallowable costs.Payments made for costs determined to be unallowable by either the awarding Federal agency, cognizant agency for indirect costs, or pass-through entity must be refunded with interest to the Federal Government. Unless directed by Federal statute or regulation, repayments must be made in accordance with the instructions provided by the Federal agency or pass-through entity that made the allowability determination. See §§ 200.300 through 200.309, and § 200.346.




200.411SECTION1§ 200.411   Adjustment of previously negotiated indirect cost rates containing unallowable costs.(a) Negotiated indirect cost rates based on a proposal later found to have included costs that:
(1) Are unallowable as specified by Federal statutes, regulations or the terms and conditions of a Federal award; or
(2) Are unallowable because they are not allocable to the Federal award(s), must be adjusted, or a refund must be made in accordance with the requirements of this section. These adjustments or refunds are intended to correct the proposals used to establish the rates and do not constitute a reopening of the rate negotiation. The adjustments or refunds must be made regardless of the type of rate negotiated (predetermined, final, fixed, or provisional).
(b) For rates covering a future fiscal year of the recipient or subrecipient, the unallowable costs must be removed from the indirect cost pools and the rates must be adjusted.
(c) For rates covering a past period, the Federal share of the unallowable costs must be computed for each year involved, and a cash refund (including interest) must be made to the Federal Government in accordance with the directions provided by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. When cash refunds are made for past periods covered by provisional or fixed rates, appropriate adjustments must be made when the rates are finalized to avoid duplicate recovery of the unallowable costs.
(d) For rates covering the current period, either a rate adjustment or a refund, as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, must be required by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. The choice of method must be at the discretion of the cognizant agency for indirect costs, based on its judgment as to which method would be most practical.
(e) The amount or proportion of unallowable costs included in each year's rate will be assumed to be the same as the amount or proportion of unallowable costs included in the base year proposal used to establish the rate.


ECFRd93f2a98b1f6455SUBJGRPDirect and Indirect Costs200.412SECTION1§ 200.412   Classification of costs.There is no universal rule for classifying certain costs as direct or indirect costs. A cost may be direct for some specific service or function but indirect for the Federal award or other final cost objective. Therefore, each cost incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances must be treated consistently either as a direct or an indirect cost to avoid possible double-charging of Federal awards. Guidelines for determining direct and indirect costs charged to Federal awards are provided in this subpart.




200.413SECTION1§ 200.413   Direct costs.(a)  Direct costs are those costs that can be identified specifically with a particular final cost objective, such as a Federal award, or other internally or externally funded activity, or that can be directly assigned to such activities relatively easily with a high degree of accuracy. Costs incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances must be treated consistently as direct or indirect costs. See § 200.405.
General.(b)  The association of costs with a Federal award determines whether costs are direct or indirect. Costs charged directly to a Federal award are typically incurred specifically for that Federal award (including, for example, supplies needed to achieve the award's objectives and the proportion of employee compensation and fringe benefits expended in relation to that specific award). Costs that otherwise would be treated as indirect costs may also be considered direct costs if they are directly related to a specific award (including, for example, extraordinary utility consumption, the cost of materials supplied from stock or services rendered by specialized facilities, cybersecurity, integrated data systems, asset management systems, performance management costs, program evaluation costs, or other institutional service operations).
Application to Federal awards.(c)  Administrative and clerical staff salaries should normally be treated as indirect costs. Direct charging of these costs may be appropriate only if they meet all of the following conditions:
Administrative and clerical staff salaries.(1) The administrative or clerical services are integral to a Federal award;
(2) Individuals involved can be specifically identified with a Federal award; and
(3) The costs are not also recovered as indirect costs.
(d)  A direct cost of a minor amount may be treated as an indirect cost, for reasons of practicality, provided that it is treated consistently for all Federal and non-Federal purposes.
Minor items.(e)  The costs of certain activities are not allowable as charges to Federal awards. Even though these costs are unallowable, they must be treated as direct costs for purposes of determining indirect cost rates and be allocated their equitable share of the recipient's or subrecipient's indirect costs if they represent activities which:
Treatment of unallowable costs in determining indirect cost rates.(1) Include the salaries of personnel;
(2) Occupy space; and
(3) Benefit from the recipient's or subrecipient's indirect costs.
(f)  For nonprofit organizations, the costs of activities performed by the nonprofit organization primarily as a service to members, clients, or the general public when significant and necessary to the organization's mission must be treated as direct costs whether or not allowable, and be allocated an equitable share of indirect costs. Some examples of these types of activities include:
Treatment of certain costs for nonprofit organizations.(1) Maintenance of membership rolls, subscriptions, publications, and related functions. See § 200.454.
(2) Providing services and information to members, the government, or the public. See §§ 200.454 and 200.450.
(3) Promotion, lobbying, and other forms of public relations. See §§ 200.421 and 200.450.
(4) Conferences (except those held to conduct the general administration of the recipient or subrecipient). See also § 200.432.
(5) Maintenance, protection, and investment of special funds not used in the recipient's or subrecipient's operation. See also § 200.442.
(6) Administration of group benefits on behalf of members or clients, including life and hospital insurance, annuity or retirement plans, and financial aid. See also § 200.431.


200.414SECTION1§ 200.414   Indirect costs.(a)  For major Institutions of Higher Education (IHE) and major nonprofit organizations, indirect costs must be classified within two broad categories: “Facilities” and “Administration.” “Facilities” is defined as depreciation on buildings, equipment and capital improvements, interest on debt associated with certain buildings, equipment and capital improvements, and operations and maintenance expenses. “Administration” is defined as general administration and general expenses such as the director's office, accounting, personnel, and all other types of expenditures not listed specifically under one of the subcategories of “Facilities” (including cross allocations from other pools, where applicable). For nonprofit organizations, library expenses are included in the “Administration” category; for IHEs, they are included in the “Facilities” category. Major IHEs are defined as those required to use the Standard Format for Submission as noted in Appendix III. Major nonprofit organizations are those which receive more than $10 million in direct Federal funding.
Facilities and administration classification.(b)  It is not always possible to specify the types of costs that may be classified as indirect costs for nonprofit organizations due to the diversity of their accounting practices. The association of a cost with a Federal award is the determining factor in distinguishing direct from indirect costs. However, typical examples of indirect cost for many nonprofit organizations may include depreciation on buildings and equipment, the costs of operating and maintaining facilities, and general administration and general expenses, such as the salaries and expenses of executive officers, personnel administration, and accounting.
Diversity of nonprofit organizations.(c)  (See § 200.306.)
Federal Agency Acceptance of Negotiated Indirect Cost Rates.(1) Negotiated indirect cost rates must be accepted by all Federal agencies. A Federal agency may use a rate different from the negotiated rate for either a class of Federal awards or a single Federal award only when required by Federal statute or regulation, or when approved by the awarding Federal agency in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(2) The Federal agency must notify OMB of any approved deviations. The recipient or subrecipient may notify OMB of any disputes with Federal agencies regarding the application of a federally negotiated indirect cost rate.
(3) The Federal agency must implement, and make publicly available, the policies, procedures and general decision-making criteria that their programs will follow to seek and justify deviations from negotiated rates.
(4) The Federal agency must include, in the notice of funding opportunity, the policies relating to indirect cost rate reimbursement or cost share as approved under paragraph (e). As appropriate, the Federal agency should incorporate discussion of these policies into its outreach activities with applicants before posting a notice of funding opportunity. See § 200.204.
(d)  Pass-through entities are subject to the requirements in § 200.332(b)(4) and must accept all federally negotiated indirect costs rates for subrecipients.
Pass-through entities.(e)  Requirements for development and submission of indirect cost rate proposals and cost allocation plans are contained in the following Appendices:
Appendices.(1) Appendix III to Part 200—Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs);
(2) Appendix IV to Part 200—Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for Nonprofit Organizations;
(3) Appendix V to Part 200—State/Local Government-wide Central Service Cost Allocation Plans;
(4) Appendix VI to Part 200—Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plans;
(5) Appendix VII to Part 200—States and Local Government and Indian Tribe Indirect Cost Proposals; and
(6) Appendix IX to Part 200—Hospital Cost Principles.
(f)  Recipients and subrecipients that do not have a current Federal negotiated indirect cost rate (including provisional rate) may elect to charge a de minimis rate of up to 15 percent of modified total direct costs (MTDC). The recipient or subrecipient is authorized to determine the appropriate rate up to this limit. Federal agencies and pass-through entities may not require recipients and subrecipients to use a de minimis rate lower than the negotiated indirect cost rate or the rate elected pursuant to this subsection unless required by Federal statute or regulation. The de minimis rate must not be applied to cost reimbursement contracts issued directly by the Federal Government in accordance with the FAR. Recipients and subrecipients are not required to use the de minimis rate. When applying the de minimis rate, costs must be consistently charged as either direct or indirect costs and may not be double charged or inconsistently charged as both. The de minimis rate does not require documentation to justify its use and may be used indefinitely. Once elected, the recipient or subrecipient must use the de minimis rate for all Federal awards until the recipient or subrecipient chooses to receive a negotiated rate.
De minimis rate.(g)  A recipient or subrecipient with a current Federal negotiated indirect cost rate may apply for a one-time extension of that agreement for up to four years. This extension will be subject to review and approval by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. If this extension is granted, the recipient or subrecipient may not request a rate review until the extension period ends. The recipient or subrecipient must re-apply to negotiate a new rate when the extension ends. After a new rate has been negotiated, the recipient or subrecipient may again apply for a one-time extension of the new rate in accordance with this paragraph.




One-time extension of indirect rates.200.415SECTION1§ 200.415   Required certifications.(a) Financial reports must include a certification, signed by an official who is authorized to legally bind the recipient, which reads as follows: “By signing this report, I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that the report is true, complete, and accurate, and the expenditures, disbursements and cash receipts are for the purposes and objectives set forth in the terms and conditions of the Federal award. I am aware that any false, fictitious, or fraudulent information, or the omission of any material fact, may subject me to criminal, civil or administrative penalties for fraud, false statements, false claims or otherwise. (U.S. Code Title 18, Section 1001 and Title 31, Sections 3729-3730 and 3801-3812).”
(b) Subrecipients under the Federal award must certify to the pass-through entity whenever applying for funds, requesting payment, and submitting financial reports: “I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that the information provided herein is true, complete, and accurate. I am aware that the provision of false, fictitious, or fraudulent information, or the omission of any material fact, may subject me to criminal, civil, or administrative consequences including, but not limited to violations of U.S. Code Title 18, Sections 2, 1001, 1343 and Title 31, Sections 3729-3730 and 3801-3812.” Each such certification must be maintained pursuant to the requirements of § 200.334. This paragraph applies to all tiers of subrecipients.
(c) Certification of cost allocation plan or indirect cost rate proposal. Each cost allocation plan or indirect cost rate proposal must comply with the following:
(1) A proposal to establish a cost allocation plan or an indirect cost rate, whether submitted to a Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs or maintained on file by the recipient, must be certified by the recipient using the  or  as set forth in appendices III through VII, and IX of this part. The certificate must be signed on behalf of the recipient by an individual at a level no lower than the vice president or chief financial officer of the recipient that submits the proposal.
Certificate of Cost Allocation PlanCertificate of Indirect Costs(2) The Federal Government may either disallow all indirect costs or unilaterally establish an indirect cost rate when the recipient fails to submit a certified proposal for establishing a rate. This rate should be based upon audited historical data or other data furnished to the cognizant agency for indirect costs and for which it can be demonstrated that all unallowable costs have been excluded. The rate established must ensure that potentially unallowable costs are not reimbursed. Alternatively, the recipient may use the de minimis indirect cost rate. See § 200.414(f).
(d) Nonprofit organizations must certify that they did not meet the definition of a major nonprofit organization as defined in § 200.414(a), if applicable.
(e) The recipient must certify that the requirements and standards for lobbying (see § 200.450) have been met when submitting its indirect cost rate proposal.


ECFRd41a10959e1acabSUBJGRPSpecial Considerations for States, Local Governments and Indian Tribes200.416SECTION1§ 200.416   Cost allocation plans and indirect cost proposals.(a) Awards to states, local governments, and Indian Tribes are often implemented at the level of department within the State, local government, or Indian Tribe. A central service cost allocation plan is established to allow such department to claim a portion of centralized service costs that are incurred in proportion to the award's activities. Examples of centralized service costs may include motor pools, computer centers, purchasing, and accounting. Since Federal awards are performed within the individual operating agencies, there needs to be a process whereby these central service costs can be identified and assigned to benefitted activities on a reasonable and consistent basis. The central service cost allocation plan establishes this process.
(b) Individual departments typically charge Federal awards for indirect costs through an indirect cost rate. A separate indirect cost rate proposal for each operating department is usually necessary to claim indirect costs under Federal awards. Indirect costs include:
(1) The indirect costs originating in each operating department of the State, local government, or Indian Tribe carrying out Federal awards; and
(2) The costs of central governmental services distributed through the central service cost allocation plan and not otherwise treated as direct costs.
(c) The requirements for developing and submitting cost allocation plans (for central service costs and public assistance programs) and indirect cost rate proposals are contained in appendices V, VI, and VII of this part.




200.417SECTION1§ 200.417   Interagency service.An operating department may provide services to another operating department of the same State, local government, or Indian Tribe. In these instances, the cost of services provided may include allowable direct costs of the service plus a pro-rated share of indirect costs. A standard indirect cost rate equal to 15 percent of the direct salaries and wages for providing the service (excluding overtime, shift premiums, and fringe benefits) may be used instead of determining the actual indirect costs of the service. These services do not include centralized services that are included in central service cost allocation plans described in Appendix V of this part.
Special Considerations for Institutions of Higher Education




200.418SECTION1§ 200.418   Costs incurred by states and local governments.Costs incurred or paid by a State or local government on behalf of and in direct benefit to its IHEs are allowable. These costs include but are not limited to fringe benefit programs such as pension costs and Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) costs. These costs are allowable regardless of whether they are recorded in the accounting records of the institutions, subject to the following conditions:
(a) The costs meet the requirements of § 200.402-200.411;
(b) The costs are properly supported by approved cost allocation plans in accordance with the applicable cost accounting principles of this part; and
(c) The costs are not otherwise borne directly or indirectly by the Federal Government.




200.419SECTION1§ 200.419   Cost accounting standards.An IHE that receive an aggregate total $50 million or more in Federal awards and instruments subject to this subpart (as specified in § 200.101) in its most recently completed fiscal year must comply with the Cost Accounting Standards Board's cost accounting standards located at 48 CFR 9905.501, 9905.502, 9905.505, and 9905.506. CAS-covered contracts and subcontracts awarded to the IHEs are subject to the broader range of CAS requirements at 48 CFR 9900 through 9999 and 48 CFR part 30 (FAR Part 30).


ECFRed1f39f9b3d4e72SUBJGRPGeneral Provisions for Selected Items of Cost200.420SECTION1§ 200.420   Considerations for selected items of cost.(a) This section provides principles to be applied in establishing the allowability of certain items involved in determining cost, in addition to other requirements of this subpart. These principles apply whether or not a particular cost item is properly treated as a direct or indirect cost.
(b) The following sections are not intended to be a comprehensive list of potential items of cost encountered under Federal awards. Failure to mention a particular item of cost, including as an example in certain sections, is not intended to imply that it is either allowable or unallowable. When determining the allowability for an item of cost, each case should be based on the treatment provided for similar or related items of cost and based on the principles described in §§ 200.402 through 200.411. In case of a discrepancy between the provisions of a specific Federal award and the provisions below, the Federal award governs. Criteria outlined in § 200.403 must be applied in determining allowability.




200.421SECTION1§ 200.421   Advertising and public relations.(a) The term advertising costs means the costs of advertising media and corollary administrative costs. Advertising media includes, but is not limited to, magazines, newspapers, radio and television, direct mail, exhibits, and electronic or computer transmittals.
(b) The only allowable advertising costs are those which are solely for:
(1) The recruitment of personnel required by the recipient or subrecipient for the performance of a Federal award (See also § 200.463);
(2) The procurement of goods and services for the performance of a Federal award;
(3) The disposal of scrap or surplus materials acquired in the performance of a Federal award except when the recipient or subrecipient is reimbursed for disposal costs at a predetermined amount; or
(4) Program outreach (for example, recruiting project participants) and other specific purposes necessary to meet the Federal award requirements.
(c) The term “public relations” includes community relations and means those activities dedicated to maintaining the recipient's or subrecipient's image or maintaining or promoting understanding and favorable relations with the community or public at large or any segment of the public.
(d) The only allowable public relations costs are:
(1) Costs specifically required by the Federal award;
(2) Costs of communicating with the public and press about specific activities or accomplishments which result from the performance of the Federal award (these costs are considered necessary as part of the outreach effort for the Federal award); or
(3) Costs of conducting general liaison with news media and government public relations officers, to the extent that such activities are limited to communication and liaison necessary to keep the public informed on matters of public concern, such as notices of funding opportunities or financial matters.
(e) Unallowable advertising and public relations costs include the following:
(1) All advertising and public relations costs other than as specified in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section;
(2) Costs of meetings, conventions, conferences, or other events related to other activities of the entity (see also § 200.432), including:
(i) Costs of displays, demonstrations, and exhibits;
(ii) Costs of meeting rooms, hospitality suites, and other special facilities used in conjunction with shows and other special events; and
(iii) Salaries and wages of employees engaged in setting up and displaying exhibits, making demonstrations, and providing briefings;
(3) Costs of promotional items and memorabilia;
(4) Costs of advertising and public relations designed solely to promote the recipient or subrecipient.




200.422SECTION1§ 200.422   Advisory councils.An advisory council or committee is a body that provides advice to the management of such entities as corporations, organizations, or foundations. Costs incurred by both internal and external advisory councils or committees are allowable if authorized by statute, the Federal agency, or as an indirect cost where allocable to Federal awards. See § 200.444, which applies to States, local governments, and Indian Tribes.




200.423SECTION1§ 200.423   Alcoholic beverages.The cost of alcoholic beverages is unallowable.




200.424SECTION1§ 200.424   Alumni activities.Costs incurred by IHEs for, or in support of, alumni activities are unallowable.




200.425SECTION1§ 200.425   Audit services.(a) A reasonably proportionate share of the costs of audits required by and performed in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507), and the requirements of this part are allowable. However, the following audit costs are unallowable:
(1) Any costs when audits required by the Single Audit Act and subpart F of this part have not been conducted, or have been conducted but not in accordance with the requirements; and
(2) Except as provided for in paragraph (c) of this section, any costs of auditing a non-Federal entity that is exempted from having an audit conducted under the Single Audit Act and subpart F of this part because its expenditures under Federal awards are less than $1,000,000 during its fiscal year.”
(b) The costs of a financial statement audit of a recipient or subrecipient that does not currently have a Federal award may be included in the indirect cost pool for a cost allocation plan or indirect cost proposal.
(c) Pass-through entities may charge Federal awards for the cost of agreed-upon procedures engagements to monitor subrecipients (in accordance with §§ 200.331-333) exempt from having an audit conducted under the Single Audit Act and the This cost is allowable only if the agreed-upon procedures engagements are:
 requirements of this part.(1) Conducted in accordance with GAGAS or applicable international attestation standards, as appropriate;
(2) Paid for and arranged by the pass-through entity; and
(3) Limited in scope to one or more of the following types of compliance requirements: activities allowed or unallowed; allowable costs/cost principles; eligibility; and reporting.




200.426SECTION1§ 200.426   Bad debts.Bad debts (debts determined to be uncollectable), including losses (whether actual or estimated) arising from uncollectable accounts and other claims, are unallowable. Related collection costs, and related legal costs, arising from such debts are also unallowable. See § 200.428.




200.427SECTION1§ 200.427   Bonding costs.(a) Bonding costs arise when the Federal agency requires assurance against financial loss to itself or others because of an act or default of the recipient or subrecipient. They also arise when the recipient or subrecipient requires similar assurance, including bonds as bid, performance, payment, advance payment, infringement, and fidelity bonds for employees and officials.
(b) Costs of bonding required under the Federal award's terms and conditions are allowable.
(c) Costs of bonding required by the recipient or subrecipient in the general conduct of its operations are allowable as an indirect cost to the extent that such bonding is in accordance with sound business practice and the rates and premiums are reasonable under the circumstances.




200.428SECTION1§ 200.428   Collections of improper payments.The costs incurred by a recipient or subrecipient to recover improper payments, including improper overpayments, are allowable as either direct or indirect costs, as appropriate. The recipient or subrecipient may use the amounts collected in accordance with cash management standards described in § 200.305.




200.429SECTION1§ 200.429   Commencement and convocation costs.For IHEs, costs incurred for commencements and convocations are unallowable, except as activity costs provided for in Appendix III, (B)(9) Student Administration and Services.




200.430SECTION1§ 200.430   Compensation—personal services.(a)  Compensation for personal services includes all remuneration, paid currently or accrued, for services of employees rendered during the period of performance under the Federal award, including but not necessarily limited to wages and salaries. Compensation for personal services may also include fringe benefits addressed in § 200.431. Costs of compensation are allowable to the extent that they satisfy the specific requirements of this part and that the total compensation for individual employees:
General.(1) Is reasonable for the services rendered and conforms to the established written policy of the recipient or subrecipient consistently applied to both Federal and non-Federal activities;
(2) Follows an appointment made in accordance with the recipient's or subrecipient's laws, rules, or written policies and meets the requirements of Federal statute, where applicable; and
(3) Is determined and supported as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, when applicable.
(b)  Compensation for employees engaged in work on Federal awards will be reasonable to the extent that it is consistent with that paid for similar work in other activities of the recipient or subrecipient. In cases where the kinds of employees required for Federal awards are not found in the other activities of the recipient or subrecipient, compensation will be considered reasonable to the extent that it is comparable to that paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient or subrecipient competes for the kind of employees involved.
Reasonableness.(c)  Unless the Federal agency expressly authorizes an arrangement, a recipient or subrecipient must follow its written policies and procedures concerning the permissible extent of professional services that can be provided outside the recipient or subrecipient for non-organizational compensation. Where the recipient or subrecipient does not have written policies or procedures, or they do not adequately define the permissible extent of consulting or other non-organizational activities undertaken for extra outside pay, the Federal Government may require the recipient or subrecipient to allocate the effort of professional staff working on Federal awards between:
Professional activities outside the recipient or subrecipient.(1) Recipient or subrecipient activities, and
(2) Non-organizational professional activities. Appropriate arrangements governing compensation must be negotiated on a case-by-case basis if the Federal agency considers the extent of non-organizational professional effort excessive or inconsistent with the conflicts-of-interest terms and conditions of the Federal award.
(d)  (1) Costs unallowable under other sections of these principles must not be allowable under this section solely because they constitute personnel compensation.
Unallowable costs.(2) The allowable compensation for certain employees is subject to a ceiling in accordance with Federal statute. See 10 U.S.C. 3744(a)(16), 41 U.S.C. 1127, and 41 U.S.C. 4304(a)(16) for the ceiling amount, covered compensation subject to the ceiling, covered employees, and other relevant provisions for cost-reimbursement contracts. For other types of Federal awards, other statutory ceilings may apply.
(e)  Special considerations in determining the allowability of compensation will be given to any change in a recipient's or subrecipient's compensation policy resulting in a substantial increase in its employees' level of compensation (particularly when the change was concurrent with an increase in the ratio of Federal awards to other activities) or any change in the treatment of allowability of specific types of compensation due to changes in Federal policy.
Special considerations.(f)  Incentive compensation to employees based on cost reduction, efficient performance, suggestion awards, or safety awards is allowable to the extent that the overall compensation is determined to be reasonable and such costs are paid or accrued according to an agreement entered into in good faith between the recipient or subrecipient and the employees before the services were rendered, or according to an established plan followed by the recipient or subrecipient so consistently as to imply, in effect, an agreement to make such payment.
Incentive compensation.(g)  (1) Charges to Federal awards for salaries and wages must be based on records that accurately reflect the work performed. These records must:
Standards for Documentation of Personnel Expenses.(i) Be supported by a system of internal control that provides reasonable assurance that the charges are accurate, allowable, and properly allocated;
(ii) Be incorporated into the official records of the recipient or subrecipient;
(iii) Reasonably reflect the total activity for which the employee is compensated by the recipient or subrecipient, not exceeding 100 percent of compensated activities (for IHEs, this is the IBS);
(iv) Encompass federally-assisted and all other activities compensated by the recipient or subrecipient on an integrated basis but may include the use of subsidiary records as defined in the recipient's or subrecipient's written policy;
(v) Comply with the established accounting policies and procedures of the recipient or subrecipient (See paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section for treatment of incidental work for IHEs.); and
(vi) Support the distribution of the employee's salary or wages among specific activities or cost objectives if the employee works on more than one Federal award; a Federal award and non-Federal award; an indirect cost activity and a direct cost activity; two or more indirect activities allocated using different allocation bases; or an unallowable activity and a direct or indirect cost activity.
(vii) Budget estimates (meaning, estimates determined before the services are performed) alone do not qualify as support for charges to Federal awards, but may be used for interim accounting purposes, provided that:
(A) The system for establishing the estimates produces reasonable approximations of the activity performed;
(B) Significant changes in the related work activity (as defined by the recipient's or subrecipient's written policies) are promptly identified and entered into the records. Short-term (such as one or two months) fluctuations between workload categories do not need to be considered as long as the distribution of salaries and wages is reasonable over the longer term; and
(C) The recipient's or subrecipient's system of internal controls includes processes to perform periodic after-the-fact reviews of interim charges made to a Federal award based on budget estimates. All necessary adjustments must be made so that the final amount charged to the Federal award is accurate, allowable, and properly allocated.
(viii) Because practices vary as to the activity constituting a full workload (for example, the Institutional Base Salary (IBS) for IHEs), records may reflect categories of activities expressed as a percentage distribution of total activities.
(ix) It is recognized that teaching, research, service, and administration are often inextricably intermingled in an academic setting. Therefore, a precise assessment of factors contributing to costs is not required when IHEs record salaries and wages charged to Federal awards.
(2) For records that meet the standards required in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the recipient or subrecipient is not required to provide additional support or documentation for the work performed other than that referenced in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
(3) In accordance with Department of Labor regulations implementing the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) (29 CFR part 516), charges for the salaries and wages of nonexempt employees, in addition to the supporting documentation described in this section, must also be supported by records indicating the total number of hours worked each day.
(4) Salaries and wages of employees used in meeting cost sharing requirements on Federal awards must be supported in the same manner as salaries and wages claimed for reimbursement from Federal awards.
(5) States, local governments, and Indian Tribes may use substitute processes or systems for allocating salaries and wages to Federal awards either in place of or in addition to the records described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section if approved by the cognizant agency for indirect cost. Such systems may include, but are not limited to, random moment sampling, “rolling” time studies, case counts, or other quantifiable measures of work performed.
(i) Substitute systems that use sampling methods (primarily for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, and other public assistance programs) must meet acceptable statistical sampling standards, including:
(A) The sampling universe must include all of the employees whose salaries and wages are to be allocated based on sample results except as provided in paragraph (g)(5)(iii);
(B) The sample must cover the entire period involved; and
(C) The results must be statistically valid and applied to the period being sampled.
(ii) Allocating charges for the sampled employees' supervisors and clerical and support staff, based on the results of the sampled employees, will be acceptable.
(iii) Less than full compliance with the statistical sampling standards noted in paragraph (5)(i) may be accepted by the cognizant agency for indirect costs if it concludes that the amounts allocated to Federal awards will be minimal or if it concludes that the system proposed by the recipient or subrecipient will result in lower costs to Federal awards than a system which complies with the standards.
(6) Cognizant agencies for indirect costs are encouraged to approve alternative proposals based on outcomes and milestones for program performance when these are clearly documented. These plans are acceptable as an alternative to requirements in paragraph (g)(1) of this section when approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.
(7) For Federal awards of similar purpose activity or instances of approved blended funding, a recipient or subrecipient may submit performance plans that incorporate funds from multiple Federal awards and account for their combined use based on performance-oriented metrics, provided the plans are approved in advance by all involved Federal agencies. In these instances, the recipient or subrecipient must submit a request for waiver of the requirements based on documentation that describes the method of charging costs, relates the charging of costs to the specific activity that is applicable to all fund sources, and is based on quantifiable measures of the activity in relation to time charged.
(8) For a recipient or subrecipient whose records do not meet the standards described in this section, the Federal Government may require personnel activity reports, including prescribed certifications, or equivalent documentation supporting the records as required in this section.
(h)  This paragraph (h) provides guidance specific to only nonprofit organizations. For compensation to members of nonprofit organizations, trustees, directors, associates, officers, or the immediate families thereof, a determination must be made that the compensation is reasonable for the actual personal services rendered rather than a distribution of earnings above actual costs. Compensation may include director's and executive committee member's fees, incentive awards, off-site or incentive pay, location allowances, hardship pay, and cost-of-living differentials.
Nonprofit organizations.(i)  This paragraph provides guidance specific to only IHEs.
Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs).(1)  Certain conditions require special consideration and possible limitations in determining allowable personnel compensation costs under Federal awards. Among such conditions are the following:
Determining allowable personnel costs.(i) Allowable activities. Charges to Federal awards may include reasonable amounts for activities contributing and directly related to work under an agreement, such as delivering special lectures about specific aspects of the ongoing activity, writing reports and articles, developing and maintaining protocols (human, animals, etcetera), managing substances/chemicals, managing and securing project-specific data, coordinating research subjects, participating in appropriate seminars, consulting with colleagues and graduate students, and attending meetings and conferences.
(ii) Incidental activities. Incidental activities for which supplemental compensation is allowable under the written institutional policy (at a rate not to exceed institutional base salary) do not need to be included in the records described in paragraph (g). To charge payments of incidental activities directly, such activities must either be expressly authorized in the Federal award budget or receive prior written approval by the Federal agency.
(2)  Charges for work performed on Federal awards by faculty members during the academic year are allowable at the institutional base salary (IBS) rate. Except as noted in paragraph (i)(1)(ii), in no event will charges to Federal awards, irrespective of the basis of computation, exceed the proportionate share of the IBS for that period. This principle applies to all members of the faculty at an institution. IBS is the annual compensation paid by an IHE for an individual's appointment, whether that individual's time is spent on research, instruction, administration, or other activities. IBS excludes any income an individual earns outside of duties performed for the IHE. Unless there is prior approval by the Federal agency, charges of a faculty member's salary to a Federal award may not exceed the proportionate share of the IBS for the period during which the faculty member worked on the Federal award.
Salary basis.(3)  Intra-IHE consulting by faculty should be undertaken as an IHE responsibility requiring no compensation in addition to IBS. However, in unusual cases where consultation is across departmental lines or involves a separate or remote operation, and the work performed by the faculty members is in addition to their regular responsibilities, any charges for such work representing additional compensation above IBS are allowable provided that such consulting arrangements are expressly authorized in the Federal award or approved in writing by the Federal agency.
Intra-Institution of Higher Education (IHE) consulting.(4)  Extra service pay typically represents overload compensation, subject to institutional compensation policies for services above and beyond IBS. Where extra service pay results from Intra-IHE consulting, it is subject to the same requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. It is allowable if all of the following conditions are met:
Extra service pay.(i) The IHE establishes consistent written policies which apply uniformly to all faculty members, not just those working on Federal awards.
(ii) The IHE establishes a consistent written definition of work covered by IBS, which is specific enough to determine conclusively when work beyond that level has occurred. This definition may be described in appointment letters or other documentation.
(iii) The supplementation amount paid is commensurate with the IBS pay rate and additional work performed. See paragraph (i)(2) of this section.
(iv) The salaries, as supplemented, fall within the salary structure and pay ranges established by and documented in writing or otherwise applicable to the IHE.
(v) The total salaries charged to Federal awards, including extra service payments, are subject to the standards of documentation as described in paragraph (g).
(5)  (i) Except as specified for teaching activity in paragraph (i)(5)(ii) of this section, charges for work performed by faculty members on Federal awards during periods not included in the base salary period must be at a rate not more than the IBS.
Periods outside the academic year.(ii) Charges for teaching activities performed by faculty members on Federal awards during periods not included in IBS period must be based on the written policy of the IHE governing compensation to faculty members for teaching assignments during such periods.
(6)  Charges for work performed on Federal awards by faculty members having only part-time appointments must be determined at a rate not more than that regularly paid for part-time assignments.
Part-time faculty.(7)  Rules for sabbatical leave are as follows:
Sabbatical leave costs.(i) Costs of leaves of absence by employees for performance of graduate work or sabbatical study, travel, or research are allowable, provided the IHE has a uniform written policy on sabbatical leave for persons engaged in instruction and persons engaged in research. These costs must be allocated equitably among all related activities of the IHE.
(ii) Where sabbatical leave is included in fringe benefits for which a cost is determined for assessment as a direct charge, the aggregate amount of such assessments applicable to all work of the institution during the base period must be reasonable in relation to the IHE's actual experience under its sabbatical leave policy.
(8)  Non-faculty full-time professional personnel may also earn “extra service pay” in accordance with the IHE's written policy and paragraph (i)(1)(i).






Salary rates for non-faculty members.200.431SECTION1§ 200.431   Compensation—fringe benefits.(a)  Fringe benefits are allowances and services employers provide to their employees as compensation in addition to regular salaries and wages. Fringe benefits include, but are not limited to, the costs of leave, employee insurance, pensions, and unemployment benefits. Except as provided elsewhere in these principles, the costs of fringe benefits are allowable provided that the benefits are reasonable and are required by law, an organization-employee agreement, or an established policy of the recipient or subrecipient.
General.(b)  The cost of fringe benefits in the form of regular compensation paid to employees during periods of authorized absences from the job, such as for annual leave, family-related leave, sick leave, holidays, court leave, military leave, administrative leave, and other similar benefits, are allowable if all of the following criteria are met:
Leave.(1) They are provided under established written leave policies;
(2) The costs are equitably allocated to all related activities, including Federal awards; and,
(3) The accounting basis (cash or accrual) selected for costing each type of leave is consistently followed by the recipient or subrecipient or a specified grouping of employees.




(i) When a recipient or subrecipient uses the cash basis of accounting, the cost of leave is recognized in the period that the leave is taken and paid for. Payments for unused leave when an employee retires or terminates employment are allowable in the year of payment and should be allocated as a general administrative expense to all activities or included in the fringe benefit rate.




(ii) The accrual basis may be only used for those types of leave for which a liability as defined by GAAP exists when the leave is earned. When a recipient or subrecipient uses the accrual basis of accounting, allowable leave costs are the lesser of the amount accrued or funded.
(c)  The cost of fringe benefits in the form of employer contributions or expenses for social security; employee life, health, unemployment, and worker's compensation insurance (except as indicated in § 200.447); pension plan costs; and other similar benefits are allowable, provided such benefits are permitted under established written policies. The recipient or subrecipient must allocate fringe benefits to Federal awards and all other activities in a manner consistent with the pattern of benefits attributable to the individuals or group(s) of employees whose salaries and wages are chargeable to such Federal awards and other activities, and charged as direct or indirect costs following the recipient's or subrecipient's accounting practices.
Fringe benefits.(d)  The recipient or subrecipient may assign fringe benefits to cost objectives by identifying specific benefits to specific individual employees or by allocating them based on entity-wide salaries and wages of the employees receiving the benefits. When the allocation method is used, separate allocations must be made to selective groupings of employees unless the recipient or subrecipient demonstrates that costs in relationship to salaries and wages do not differ significantly for different groups of employees.
Cost objectives.(e)  See also § 200.447(d)(1) and (2).
Insurance.(1) Provisions for a reserve under a self-insurance program for unemployment compensation or workers' compensation are allowable to the extent that the provisions represent reasonable estimates of the liabilities for such compensation and the types of coverage, the extent of coverage, and rates and premiums would have been allowable had insurance been purchased to cover the risks. However, provisions for self-insured liabilities which do not become payable for more than one year after the provision is made must not exceed the present value of the liability.
(2) Insurance costs on the lives of trustees, officers, or other employees holding positions of similar responsibility are allowable only to the extent that the insurance represents additional compensation. The cost of such insurance is unallowable when the recipient or subrecipient is named as beneficiary.
(3) Actual claims paid to or on behalf of employees or former employees for workers' compensation, unemployment compensation, severance pay, and similar employee benefits ( post-retirement health benefits) are allowable in the year of payment provided that the recipient or subrecipient follows a consistent costing policy.
for example,(f)  That portion of automobile costs furnished by the recipient or subrecipient that relates to personal use by employees (including transportation to and from work) is unallowable as a fringe benefit or indirect costs regardless of whether the cost is reported as taxable income to the employees.
Automobiles.(g)  Pension plan costs incurred in accordance with the established written policies of the recipient or subrecipient are allowable, provided that:
Pension plan costs.(1) Such policies meet the test of reasonableness.
(2) The methods of cost allocation are not discriminatory.
(3) The cost assigned to each fiscal year should be determined in accordance with GAAP, except for State and local governments.
(4) The costs assigned to a given fiscal year are funded for all plan participants within six months after the end of that year. However, increases to normal and past service pension costs caused by a delay in funding the actuarial liability beyond 30 calendar days after each quarter of the year to which such costs are assignable are unallowable. The recipient or subrecipient may follow the “Cost Accounting Standard for Composition and Measurement of Pension Costs” (48 CFR 9904.412).
(5) Premiums for pension plan termination insurance that are paid according to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1301-1461) are allowable. Late payment charges on such premiums are unallowable. Excise taxes on accumulated funding deficiencies and other penalties imposed under ERISA are unallowable.
(6) Pension plan costs may be computed using a pay-as-you-go method or an actuarial cost method recognized by GAAP and following the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policies.
(i) For pension plans financed on a pay-as-you-go method, allowable costs will be limited to those representing actual payments to retirees or their beneficiaries.
(ii) Pension costs calculated using an actuarial cost method recognized by GAAP are allowable for a given fiscal year if they are funded for that year within six months after the end of that year. Costs funded after six months (or a later period agreed to by the cognizant agency for indirect costs) are allowable in the year funded. The cognizant agency for indirect costs may agree to an extension if an appropriate adjustment is made to compensate for the timing of the charges to the Federal Government and related Federal reimbursement and the recipient's or subrecipient's contribution to the pension fund. Adjustments may be made by cash refund or other equitable procedures to compensate the Federal Government for the time value of Federal reimbursements in excess of contributions to the pension fund.
(iii) Amounts funded by the recipient or subrecipient in excess of the actuarially determined amount for a fiscal year may be used as the recipient's or subrecipient's contribution in future periods.
(iv) When a recipient or subrecipient establishes or converts to an acceptable actuarial cost method, as defined by GAAP, and funds pension costs in accordance with this method, the unfunded liability at the time of conversion is allowable if amortized over a period of years in accordance with GAAP.
(v) Payments for unfunded pension costs must be charged in accordance with the allocation principles of this subpart. Specifically, the recipient or subrecipient may not charge unfunded pension costs directly to a Federal award if those unfunded pension costs are not allocable to that award.
(vi) The recipient or subrecipient must provide the Federal Government an equitable share of any previously allowed pension costs (including subsequent earnings) that revert or inure to the recipient or subrecipient through a refund, withdrawal, or other credit.
(h)  A post-retirement health plan (PRHP) refers to the costs of health insurance or health services not included in a pension plan covered by paragraph (g) for retirees and their spouses, dependents, and survivors. PRHP costs may be computed using a pay-as-you-go method or an actuarial cost method recognized by GAAP and following the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policies.
Post-retirement health.(1) For PRHP financed on a pay-as-you-go method, allowable costs will be limited to those representing actual payments to retirees or their beneficiaries.
(2) PRHP costs calculated using an actuarial cost method recognized by GAAP are allowable for a given fiscal year if they are funded for that year within six months after the end of that year. Costs funded after six months (or a later period agreed to by the cognizant agency for indirect costs) are allowable in the year funded. The cognizant agency for indirect costs may agree to an extension if an appropriate adjustment is made to compensate for the timing of the charges to the Federal Government and related Federal reimbursement and the recipient's or subrecipient's contributions to the PRHP fund. Adjustments may be made by cash refund, reduction in the current year's PRHP costs, or other equitable procedures to compensate the Federal Government for the time value of Federal reimbursements in excess of contributions to the PRHP fund.
(3) Amounts funded by the recipient or subrecipient in excess of the actuarially determined amount for a fiscal year may be used as the recipient's or subrecipient's contribution in future periods.
(4) If a recipient or subrecipient establishes or converts to an actuarial cost method and funds PRHP costs in accordance with this method, the initial unfunded liability attributable to prior years is allowable if amortized over a period of years in accordance with GAAP, or, if no such GAAP period exists, over a period negotiated with the cognizant agency for indirect costs.
(5) Payments for unfunded PRHP costs must be charged in accordance with the allocation principles of this subpart. Specifically, the recipient or subrecipient may not charge unfunded PRHP costs directly to a Federal award if those unfunded PRHP costs are not allocable to that award.
(6) To be allowable in the current year, the PRHP costs must be paid either to:
(i) An insurer or other benefit provider as current year costs or premiums; or
(ii) An insurer or trustee that will maintain a trust fund or reserve for the sole purpose of providing post-retirement benefits to retirees and other beneficiaries.
(7) The recipient or subrecipient must provide the Federal Government an equitable share of any previously allowed post-retirement benefit costs (including subsequent earnings) that revert or inure to the recipient or subrecipient through a refund, withdrawal, or other credit.
(i)  (1) Severance pay, also commonly referred to as dismissal wages, is a payment in addition to regular salaries and wages, by recipients and subrecipients to workers whose employment is being terminated. Severance pay is allowable only to the extent that, in each case, it is required by:
Severance pay.(i) Law;
(ii) Employer-employee agreement;
(iii) Established policy that constitutes, in effect, an implied agreement on the recipient's or subrecipient's part; or
(iv) Circumstances of the particular employment.
(2) Costs of severance payments are divided into two categories as follows:
(i) Actual severance payments for normal turnover must be allocated to all activities; or, where the recipient or subrecipient provides for a reserve for normal severances, such method is acceptable if the charge to current operations is reasonable in light of payments made for normal severances over a representative past period, and if amounts charged are allocated to all activities of the recipient or subrecipient.
(ii) Measuring the costs of abnormal or mass severance pay by means of an accrual method will not achieve equity for both parties. Therefore, accruals are not allowable. However, the Federal Government recognizes its responsibility to contribute its fair share toward a specific payment. Prior approval by the Federal agency or cognizant agency for indirect cost, as appropriate, is required.
(3) Costs incurred in severance pay packages that are in excess of the standard severance pay provided by the recipient or subrecipient to an employee upon termination of employment and that are paid to the employee contingent upon a change in management control over, or ownership of, the recipient's or subrecipient's assets, are unallowable.
(4) Severance payments to foreign nationals employed by the recipient or subrecipient outside the United States, to the extent that the amount exceeds the customary or prevailing practices for the recipient or subrecipient in the United States, are unallowable unless they are required by applicable foreign law or necessary for the performance of Federal programs and approved by the Federal agency.
(5) Severance payments to foreign nationals employed by the recipient or subrecipient outside the United States due to the termination of the foreign national as a result of the closing of, or curtailment of activities by, the recipient or subrecipient in that country, are unallowable unless they are either:
(i) Required by applicable foreign law; or
(ii) Necessary for the performance of Federal programs and approved by the Federal agency.
(j)  (1) Fringe benefits in the form of undergraduate and graduate tuition or tuition remission for individual employees are allowable, provided such benefits are granted in accordance with established written policies of the IHE and are distributed to all IHE activities on an equitable basis. Tuition benefits for family members other than the employee are unallowable.
For IHEs only.(2) Fringe benefits in the form of undergraduate and graduate tuition or tuition remission for individual employees not employed by the IHE are limited to the tax-free amount allowed by the Internal Revenue Code as amended (26 U.S.C. 127).
(3) IHEs may offer employees tuition waivers or reductions, provided that the benefit does not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. Employees can exercise these benefits at other institutions according to institutional policy. See § 200.466, for treatment of tuition remission provided to students.
(k)  (1) For IHEs whose costs are paid by a State or local government, fringe benefit programs (such as pension costs and FICA) and any other benefits costs incurred specifically on behalf of, and in direct benefit to, the IHE, are allowable, subject to the following:
Fringe benefit programs and other benefit costs.(i) The costs meet the requirements of Basic Considerations in §§ 200.402 through 200.411;
(ii) The costs are properly supported by approved cost allocation plans in accordance with applicable Federal cost accounting principles; and
(iii) The costs are not otherwise borne directly or indirectly by the Federal Government.
(2) The allowability of these costs for the IHE does not depend on whether they are recorded in the accounting records of the IHE.

N200.432SECTION1§ 200.432   Conferences.A conference means an event whose primary purpose is to disseminate technical information beyond the recipient or subrecipient and is necessary and reasonable for successful performance under the Federal award. Allowable conference costs may include the rental of facilities, speakers' fees, attendance fees, costs of meals and refreshments, local transportation, and other items incidental to such conferences unless further restricted by the terms and conditions of the Federal award. The costs of identifying and providing locally available dependent-care resources for participants are allowable as needed. Conference hosts/sponsors must exercise discretion and judgment in ensuring that conference costs are appropriate, necessary, and managed to minimize costs to the Federal award. The Federal agency may authorize exceptions for programs including Indian Tribes, children, and the elderly. See also §§ 200.438, 200.456, and 200.475.




200.433SECTION1§ 200.433   Contingency provisions.(a) Contingency provisions are part of a budget estimate of future costs (typically of large construction projects, IT systems, or other items approved by the Federal agency) which are associated with possible events or conditions arising from causes for which the precise outcome is indeterminable at the time of estimate and that are likely to result, in the aggregate, in additional costs for the approved activity or project. Contingency amounts for major project scope changes, unforeseen risks, or extraordinary events must not be included in the budget estimates for a Federal award.
(b) It is permissible for contingency amounts other than those excluded in paragraph (a) of this section to be explicitly included in budget estimates to the extent necessary to improve their precision. Contingency amounts must be estimated using broadly-accepted cost estimating methodologies, specified in the budget documentation of the Federal award, and accepted by the Federal agency. As such, contingency amounts are to be included in the Federal award. In order for actual costs incurred to be allowable, they must comply with the cost principles and other requirements of this part (see §§ 200.300 and 200.403), be necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives, and be verifiable from the recipient's or subrecipient's records.
(c) Payments to a recipient's or subrecipient's “contingency reserve” or any similar payment made for events the occurrence of which cannot be foretold with certainty as to the time or intensity, or with an assurance of their happening, are unallowable, except as noted in §§ 200.431 and 200.447.




200.434SECTION1§ 200.434   Contributions and donations.(a) Costs of contributions and donations, including cash, property, and services, from the recipient or subrecipient to other entities are unallowable.
(b) The value of services and property donated (that is, in-kind donations) to the recipient or subrecipient may not be charged to the Federal award either as a direct or indirect cost. The value of donated services and property may be used to meet cost sharing requirements (see § 200.306). Depreciation on donated assets is permitted so long as the donated property is not counted towards meeting cost sharing requirements (see § 200.436).
(c) Services donated or volunteered to the recipient or subrecipient may be provided by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor. The value of these services may not be charged to the Federal award as a direct or indirect cost. However, the value of donated services may be used to meet cost sharing requirements in accordance with the provisions of § 200.306.
(d) To the extent feasible, services donated to the recipient or subrecipient will be supported by the same methods used to support the allocability of regular personnel services.
(e) The following provisions apply to nonprofit organizations. The value of services donated to a nonprofit organization and used in the performance of a direct cost activity must be considered in the determination of the recipient's or subrecipient's indirect cost rate(s) and, accordingly, must be allocated a proportionate share of applicable indirect costs when the following circumstances exist:
(1) The aggregate value of the services is material;
(2) The services are supported by a significant amount of the indirect costs incurred by the recipient or subrecipient;
(i) In those instances where there is no basis for determining the fair market value of the services rendered, the recipient or subrecipient and the cognizant agency for indirect costs must negotiate an appropriate allocation of indirect cost to the services.
(ii) Where donated services directly benefit a project supported by the Federal award, the indirect costs allocated to the services will be considered as a part of the project's total costs. Such indirect costs may be reimbursed under the Federal award or used to meet cost sharing requirements.
(f) Fair market value of donated services must be computed as described in § 200.306.
(g) Personal property and use of space.
(1) Donated personal property and use of space may be furnished to a recipient or subrecipient. The value of the personal property and space may not be charged to the Federal award either as a direct or indirect cost.
(2) The value of the donations of personal property and use of space may be used to meet cost sharing requirements described in § 200.300. The recipient or subrecipient must value the donations in accordance with § 200.300. Where the recipient or subrecipient treats donations as indirect costs, indirect cost rates must separate the value of the donations so that reimbursement is not made.


200.435SECTION1§ 200.435   Defense and prosecution of criminal and civil proceedings, claims, appeals and patent infringements.(a) —(1)  means a judgment or conviction of a criminal offense by any court of competent jurisdiction, whether entered upon verdict or a plea, including a conviction due to a plea of nolo contendere.
Definitions for this sectionConviction(2)  include the services that bear a direct relationship to a judicial or administrative proceeding and provided by in-house or private counsel, accountants, consultants, or others engaged to assist the recipient or subrecipient before, during, or after the commencement of that proceeding.
Costs(3)  means:
Fraud(i) Acts of fraud or corruption or attempts to defraud the Federal Government or to corrupt its agents,
(ii) Acts that constitute a cause for debarment or suspension (as specified in agency regulations), and
(iii) Acts that violate the False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3732) or the Anti-kickback Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b)).
(4)  does not include restitution, reimbursement, or compensatory damages.
Penalty(5)  includes an investigation.
Proceeding(b)  (1) Except as otherwise described herein, costs incurred in connection with any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding (including the filing of a false certification) commenced by the Federal Government, a State, local government, or foreign government, or joined by the Federal Government (including a proceeding under the False Claims Act), against the recipient or subrecipient, (or commenced by third parties or a current or former employee of the recipient or subrecipient who submits a whistleblower complaint of reprisal in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 4701 or 41 U.S.C. 4712), are not allowable if the proceeding:
Costs.(i) Relates to a violation of, or failure to comply with, a Federal, State, local or foreign statute, regulation, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award by the recipient or subrecipient (including its agents and employees); and
(ii) Results in any of the following dispositions:
(A) In a criminal proceeding, a conviction.
(B) In a civil or administrative proceeding involving an allegation of fraud or similar misconduct, a determination of recipient or subrecipient liability.
(C) In the case of any civil or administrative proceeding, the disallowance of costs, the imposition of a monetary penalty, or an order issued by the Federal agency head or delegate to the recipient or subrecipient to take corrective action under 10 U.S.C. 4701 or 41 U.S.C. 4712.
(D) A final decision by an appropriate Federal official to debar or suspend the recipient or subrecipient, to rescind or void a Federal award, or to terminate a Federal award because of a violation or failure to comply with a statute, regulation, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award.
(E) A disposition by consent or compromise if the action could have resulted in any of the dispositions described in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section.
(2) If more than one proceeding involves the same alleged misconduct, the costs of all such proceedings are unallowable if any results in one of the dispositions shown in paragraph (b) of this section.
(c)  If a proceeding referred to in paragraph (b) of this section is commenced by the Federal Government and is resolved by consent or compromise pursuant to an agreement by the recipient or subrecipient and the Federal Government, then the costs incurred may be allowed to the extent expressly authorized in the agreement.
Allowability of costs for proceeding commenced by Federal Government.(d)  If a proceeding referred to in paragraph (b) of this section is commenced by a State, local or foreign government, then the costs incurred may be allowed if the authorized Federal official determines that the costs were incurred as a result of:
Allowability of costs for proceeding commenced by State, local, or foreign government.(1) A specific term or condition of the Federal award, or
(2) Specific written direction of an authorized official of the Federal agency.
(e)  Costs incurred in connection with proceedings described in paragraph (b), and not made unallowable by that paragraph, may be allowed to the extent that:
Allowability of costs in general.(1) The costs are reasonable and necessary for the administration of the Federal award and activities required to deal with the proceeding and the underlying cause of action;
(2) Payment of the reasonable, necessary, allocable and otherwise allowable costs incurred is not prohibited by any other provision(s) of the Federal award;
(3) The costs are not recovered from the Federal Government or a third party, either directly as a result of the proceeding or otherwise; and,
(4) An authorized Federal official has determined the percentage of costs allowed considering the complexity of litigation, generally accepted principles governing the award of legal fees in civil actions involving the United States, and other factors that may be appropriate. This percentage must not exceed 80 percent unless an agreement under paragraph (c) has explicitly considered this limitation and permitted a higher percentage. In that case, the total amount of costs incurred may be allowable.
(f)  Costs incurred by the recipient or subrecipient in connection with the defense of suits brought by its employees or ex-employees under section 2 of the Major Fraud Act of 1988 (18 U.S.C. 1031), including the cost of all relief necessary to make the employee whole, where the recipient or subrecipient was found liable or settled, are unallowable.
Major Fraud Act.(g)  Costs for prosecuting claims against the Federal Government, including appeals of final Federal agency decisions, are unallowable.
Un-allowability of costs for prosecuting claims against Federal Government.(h)  Costs of legal, accounting, and consultant services, and related costs incurred in connection with patent infringement litigation, are unallowable unless otherwise provided for in the Federal award.
Patent infringement litigation.(i)  Costs that may be unallowable under this section, including directly associated costs, must be segregated and accounted for separately. During the pendency of any proceeding covered by paragraphs (b) and (f) of this section, the Federal Government must generally withhold payment of such costs. However, if in its best interests, the Federal Government may provide for conditional payment upon provision of adequate security, or other adequate assurance, and agreement to repay all unallowable costs, plus interest, if the costs are subsequently determined to be unallowable.




Potentially unallowable costs.200.436SECTION1§ 200.436   Depreciation.(a) Depreciation is the method for allocating the cost of fixed assets to periods benefitting from asset use. The recipient or subrecipient may be compensated for the use of its buildings, capital improvements, equipment, and software projects capitalized in accordance with GAAP provided that they are needed and used in the recipient's or subrecipient's activities and correctly allocated to Federal awards. The compensation must be made by computing the proper depreciation.
(b) The allocation for depreciation must be made in accordance with Appendices III through IX of this part.
(c) Depreciation is computed applying the following rules. The computation of depreciation must be based on the acquisition cost of the assets involved. For an asset donated to the recipient or subrecipient by a third party, its fair market value at the time of the donation must be considered as the acquisition cost. Such assets may be depreciated or claimed as cost sharing but not both. When computing depreciation charges, the acquisition cost will exclude:
(1) The cost of land;
(2) Any portion of the cost of buildings and equipment borne by or donated by the Federal Government, irrespective of where the title was originally vested or is presently located;
(3) Any portion of the cost of buildings and equipment contributed by or for the recipient or subrecipient that is already claimed as cost sharing or where law or agreement prohibits recovery; and
(4) Any asset acquired solely for the performance of a non-Federal award.
(d) When computing depreciation charges, the following must be observed:
(1) The period of useful service or useful life established in each case for usable capital assets must take into consideration such factors as the type of construction, nature of the equipment, technological developments in the particular area, historical data, and the renewal and replacement policies followed for the individual items or classes of assets involved.
(2) The depreciation method used to charge the cost of an asset (or group of assets) to accounting periods must reflect the pattern of consumption of the asset during its useful life. In the absence of clear evidence indicating that the expected consumption of the asset will be significantly greater in the early portions than in the later portions of its useful life, the straight-line method must be presumed to be the appropriate method. Once used, depreciation methods may not be changed unless approved in advance by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. The depreciation methods used to calculate the depreciation amounts for indirect cost rate purposes must be the same methods used by the recipient or subrecipient for its financial statements.
(3) The entire building, including the shell and all components, may be treated as a single asset and depreciated over a single useful life. A building may also be divided into multiple components. Each component may be depreciated over its estimated useful life in this case. The building components must be grouped into three general components: building shell (including construction and design costs), building services systems (for example, elevators, HVAC, and plumbing system), and fixed equipment (for example, sterilizers, casework, fume hoods, cold rooms, and glassware/washers). A cognizant agency for indirect costs may authorize a recipient or subrecipient to use more than these three groupings in exceptional cases. When a recipient or subrecipient elects to depreciate its buildings by their components, the same depreciation method must be used for indirect and financial statements purposes, as described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2).
(4) No depreciation may be allowed on assets that have outlived their depreciable lives.
(5) Where the depreciation method is introduced to replace the use allowance method, depreciation must be computed as if the asset had been depreciated over its entire life (meaning, from the date the asset was acquired and ready for use to the date of disposal or withdrawal from service). The total amount of use allowance and depreciation for an asset (including imputed depreciation applicable to periods before the conversion from the use allowance method and depreciation after the conversion) may not exceed the total acquisition cost of the asset.
(e) Adequate property records must support depreciation charges, and physical inventories must be taken at least once every two years to ensure that the assets exist and are usable, used, and needed. The recipient or subrecipient may use statistical sampling techniques when taking these inventories. In addition, the recipient or subrecipient must maintain adequate depreciation records showing the amount of depreciation.




200.437SECTION1§ 200.437   Employee health and welfare costs.(a) Costs incurred in accordance with the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policies for improving working conditions, employer-employee relations, employee health, and employee performance are allowable.
(b) These costs must be equitably apportioned to all activities of the recipient or subrecipient. Income generated from these activities must be credited to the cost thereof unless such income has been irrevocably sent to employee welfare organizations.
(c) Losses resulting from operating food services are allowable only if the recipient's or subrecipient's objective is to operate food services on a break-even basis. Losses sustained because of operating objectives other than the above are allowable only when:
(1) The recipient or subrecipient can demonstrate unusual circumstances; and
(2) Approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.




200.438SECTION1§ 200.438   Entertainment and prizes.(a)  Costs of entertainment, including amusement, diversion, and social activities and any associated costs (such as gifts), are unallowable unless they have a specific and direct programmatic purpose and are included in a Federal award.
Entertainment costs.(b)  Costs of prizes or challenges are allowable if they have a specific and direct programmatic purpose and are included in the Federal award. Federal agencies should refer to OMB guidance in M-10-11 “Guidance on the Use of Challenges and Prizes to Promote Open Government,” issued March 8, 2010, or its successor.




Prizes.200.439SECTION1§ 200.439   Equipment and other capital expenditures.(a) See § 200.1 for the definitions of 
capital expenditures, equipment, special purpose equipment, general purpose equipment, acquisition cost, and capital assets.(b) The following rules of allowability must apply to equipment and other capital expenditures:
(1) Capital expenditures for general purpose equipment, buildings, and land are allowable as direct costs, but only with the prior written approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity.
(2) Capital expenditures for special purpose equipment are allowable as direct costs, provided that items with a unit cost of $10,000 or more have the prior written approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity.
(3) Capital expenditures for improvements to land, buildings, or equipment that materially increase their value or useful life are allowable as a direct cost, but only with the prior written approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity. See § 200.436 on the allowability of depreciation on buildings, capital improvements, and equipment. See § 200.465 on the allowability of real property and equipment rental costs.
(4) When approved as a direct cost in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) through (3), capital expenditures must be charged in the period in which the expenditure is incurred or as otherwise determined appropriate and negotiated with the Federal agency.
(5) The recipient or subrecipient may claim the unamortized portion of any equipment written off as a result of a change in capitalization levels by continuing to claim the otherwise allowable depreciation on the equipment or by amortizing the amount to be written off over a period of years negotiated with the cognizant agency for indirect cost.
(6) Cost of equipment disposal. If the Federal agency instructs the recipient or subrecipient to otherwise dispose of or transfer the equipment, the costs of disposal or transfer are allowable.
(7) Equipment and other capital expenditures are unallowable as indirect costs. See § 200.436.




200.440SECTION1§ 200.440   Exchange rates.(a) Cost increases for fluctuations in exchange rates are allowable costs subject to the availability of funding. Prior approval of exchange rate fluctuations is required only when the change results in the need for additional Federal funding, or the increased costs result in the need to significantly reduce the scope of the project. Before providing approval, the Federal agency must ensure that adequate funds are available to cover currency fluctuations in order to avoid a violation of the Antideficiency Act.
(b) The recipient or subrecipient is required to make reviews of local currency gains to determine the need for additional Federal funding before the expiration date of the Federal award. Subsequent adjustments for currency increases may be allowable only when the recipient or subrecipient provides the Federal agency with adequate source documentation from a commonly used source in effect at the time the expense was made, and to the extent that sufficient Federal funds are available.




200.441SECTION1§ 200.441   Fines, penalties, damages and other settlements.Costs resulting from recipient or subrecipient violations of, alleged violations of, or failure to comply with, Federal, State, local, tribal, or foreign laws and regulations are unallowable, except when incurred as a result of compliance with specific provisions of the Federal award, or with the prior written approval of the Federal agency. See § 200.435.




200.442SECTION1§ 200.442   Fundraising and investment management costs.(a) Costs of organized fundraising, including financial campaigns, endowment drives, solicitation of gifts and bequests, and similar expenses incurred to raise capital or obtain contributions, are unallowable. Fundraising costs for meeting the Federal program objectives are allowable with the prior written approval of the Federal agency.
(b) Costs of investment counsel and staff and similar expenses incurred to enhance income from investments are unallowable except when associated with investments covering pension, self-insurance, or other funds, which include Federal participation allowed by this part.
(c) Costs related to the physical custody and control of monies and securities are allowable.
(d) Both allowable and unallowable fundraising and investment activities must be allocated an appropriate share of indirect costs in accordance with § 200.413.




200.443SECTION1§ 200.443   Gains and losses on the disposition of depreciable assets.(a) The recipient or subrecipient must include gains and losses on the sale, retirement, or other disposition of depreciable property in the year they occur as credits or charges to the asset cost grouping(s) of the property. The amount of the gain or loss is the difference between the amount realized on the property and the undepreciated basis of the property.
(b) Gains and losses from the disposition of depreciable property must not be recognized as a separate credit or charge under the following conditions:
(1) The gain or loss is processed through a depreciation account and is reflected in the depreciation allowable under §§ 200.436 and 200.439.
(2) The property is given in exchange as part of the purchase price of a similar item, and the gain or loss is taken into account in determining the depreciation cost basis of the new item.
(3) A loss results from failing to maintain proper insurance, except as provided in § 200.447.
(4) Compensation for the use of the property was provided through use allowances instead of depreciation.
(5) Gains and losses arising from extraordinary or bulk sales, retirements, or other dispositions must be considered on a case-by-case basis.
(c) Gains or losses of any nature arising from the sale or exchange of property other than the property covered in paragraph (a) of this section must be excluded in computing Federal award costs.
(d) When assets acquired with Federal funds, in part or wholly, are disposed of, the distribution of the proceeds must be made in accordance with §§ 200.310 through 200.316.




200.444SECTION1§ 200.444   General costs of government.(a) For states, local governments, and Indian Tribes, the general costs of government are unallowable except as provided in § 200.475. Unallowable costs include:
(1) Salaries and expenses of the Office of the Governor of a State or the chief executive of a local government or the chief executive of an Indian Tribe;
(2) Salaries and other expenses of a State legislature, tribal council, or similar local governmental body, such as a county supervisor, city council, or school board, whether incurred for purposes of legislation or executive direction;
(3) Costs of the judicial branch of a government;
(4) Costs of prosecutorial activities unless treated as a direct cost to a specific program if authorized by statute or regulation. However, this does not preclude the allowability of other legal activities of the Attorney General as described in § 200.435; and
(5) Costs of other general types of government services normally provided to the general public, such as fire and police, unless provided as a direct cost under a program statute or regulation.
(b) Indian Tribes and Councils of Governments (COGs) (see definition for  in § 200.1) may include up to 50 percent of salaries and expenses directly attributable to managing and operating Federal programs by the chief executive and their staff in the indirect cost calculation without documentation.




Local government200.445SECTION1§ 200.445   Goods or services for personal use.(a) Costs of goods or services for the personal use of the recipient's or subrecipient's employees are unallowable regardless of whether the cost is reported as taxable income to the employees.
(b) Housing costs (for example, depreciation, maintenance, utilities, furnishings, rent), housing allowances, and personal living expenses for the recipient's or subrecipient's employees are only allowable as direct costs and must be approved in advance by the Federal agency.






200.446SECTION1§ 200.446   Idle facilities and idle capacity.(a) Definitions for the purpose of this section:
(1) Facilities means land and buildings or any portion thereof, equipment individually or collectively, or any other tangible capital asset, wherever located, and whether owned or leased by the recipient or subrecipient.
(2) Idle facilities mean completely unused facilities that exceed the recipient's or subrecipient's current needs.
(3) Idle capacity means the unused capacity of partially used facilities. It is the difference between:
(i) That which a facility could achieve under 100 percent operating time on a one-shift basis less operating interruptions resulting from time lost for repairs, setups, unsatisfactory materials, and other normal delays; and
(ii) The extent to which the facility was actually used to meet demands during the accounting period. A multi-shift basis should be used if it can be shown that this amount of usage would normally be expected for the type of facility involved.
(4) Cost of idle facilities or idle capacity means maintenance, repair, housing, rent, and other related costs (for example, insurance, interest, and depreciation). These costs could include the costs of idle public safety emergency facilities, telecommunications, or information technology system capacity that is built to withstand major fluctuations in load (for example, consolidated data centers).
(b) The costs of idle facilities are unallowable except to the extent that:
(1) They are necessary to meet workload requirements which may fluctuate, and are allocated appropriately to all benefiting programs; or
(2) Although not necessary to meet fluctuations in workload, they were necessary when acquired and are now idle because of changes in program requirements, efforts to achieve more economical operations, reorganization, termination, or other causes which could not have been reasonably foreseen. Under this exception, costs of idle facilities are allowable for a reasonable period, ordinarily not to exceed one year, depending on the initiative taken to use, lease, or dispose of such facilities.
(c) The costs of idle capacity are normal costs of doing business and are a factor in the normal fluctuations of usage or indirect cost rates from period to period. These costs are allowable, provided that the capacity is reasonably anticipated to be necessary to carry out the purpose of the Federal award or was originally reasonable and is not subject to reduction or elimination by use on other Federal awards, subletting, renting, or sale, in accordance with sound business, economic, or security practices. Widespread idle capacity throughout an entire facility or among a group of assets having substantially the same function may be considered idle facilities.




200.447SECTION1§ 200.447   Insurance and indemnification.(a) Costs of insurance required or approved and maintained by the terms and conditions of the Federal award are allowable.
(b) Costs of other insurance in connection with the general conduct of activities are allowable subject to the following limitations:
(1) The types, extent, and cost of coverage are in accordance with the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policy and sound business practices.
(2) Costs of insurance or contributions to any reserve covering the risk of loss of, or damage to, Federal Government property are unallowable except to the extent that the Federal agency has approved the costs.
(3) Costs allowed for business interruption or other similar insurance must exclude coverage of management fees.
(4) Insurance costs on the lives of trustees, officers, or other employees holding positions of similar responsibilities are allowable only when the insurance represents additional compensation (see § 200.431). This insurance is unallowable when the recipient or subrecipient is identified as the beneficiary.
(5) Insurance costs to correct defects in the recipient's or subrecipient's materials or workmanship are unallowable.
(6) Medical liability (malpractice) insurance is an allowable cost of a Federal research program only when the program involves human subjects or training of participants in research techniques. Medical liability insurance costs must be treated as a direct cost and assigned to individual projects based on how the insurer allocates the risk to the population covered by the insurance.
(c) Actual losses which could have been covered by permissible insurance (through a self-insurance program or otherwise) are unallowable unless expressly authorized in the Federal award. However, costs incurred because of losses not covered under nominal deductible insurance coverage provided in keeping with sound management practice, and minor losses not covered by insurance, such as spoilage, breakage, and disappearance of small hand tools, which occur in the ordinary course of operations, are allowable.
(d) Contributions to a reserve for a self-insurance program, including workers' compensation, unemployment compensation, and severance pay, are allowable subject to the following requirements:
(1) The type, extent, and cost of coverage and the rates and premiums would have been allowed had insurance (including reinsurance) been purchased to cover the risks. However, a provision for known or reasonably estimated self-insured liabilities, which do not become payable for more than one year after the provision is made, must not exceed the discounted present value of the liability. The rate used for discounting the liability must be determined by considering factors such as the recipient's or subrecipient's settlement rate for those liabilities and its investment rate of return.
(2) Earnings or investment income on reserves must be credited to those reserves.
(3)(i) Contributions to reserves must be based on sound actuarial principles using historical experience and reasonable assumptions. Reserve levels must be analyzed and updated at least biennially for each major risk being insured and take into account any reinsurance, coinsurance, and other relevant factors or information. Reserve levels related to employee-related coverages must normally be limited to the value of claims:
(A) Submitted and adjudicated but not paid;
(B) Submitted but not adjudicated; and
(C) Incurred but not submitted.
(ii) Reserve exceeding the levels described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section must be identified and justified in the cost allocation plan or indirect cost rate proposal.
(4) Accounting records, actuarial studies, and cost allocations (or billings) must recognize any significant differences due to the types of insured risk and losses generated by the various insured activities or agencies of the recipient or subrecipient. If individual departments or agencies of the recipient or subrecipient experience significantly different levels of claims for a particular risk, those differences must be recognized by using separate allocations or other techniques resulting in an equitable allocation.
(5) Whenever funds are transferred from a self-insurance reserve to other accounts (for example, general fund or unrestricted account), refunds must be made to the Federal Government for its share of funds transferred, including earned or imputed interest from the date of transfer and debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with the claims collection regulations of the cognizant agency for indirect cost.
(e) Insurance refunds must be credited against insurance costs in the year the refund is received.
(f) Indemnification includes securing the recipient or subrecipient against liabilities to third persons and other losses not compensated by insurance or otherwise. The Federal Government is obligated to indemnify the recipient or subrecipient only to the extent expressly provided for in the Federal award, except as provided in paragraph (c).




200.448SECTION1§ 200.448   Intellectual property.(a)  (1) The following costs related to securing patents and copyrights are allowable:
Patent and copyright costs.(i) Costs of preparing disclosures, reports, and other documents required by the Federal award and of searching the art to the extent necessary to make such disclosures;
(ii) Costs of preparing documents and any other patent costs in connection with the filing and prosecution of a United States patent application where the Federal Government requires that a title or a royalty-free license be conveyed to the Federal Government; and
(iii) General counseling services relating to patent and copyright matters, such as advice on patent and copyright laws, regulations, clauses, and employee intellectual property agreements (See § 200.459).
(2) The following costs related to securing patents and copyrights are unallowable:
(i) Costs of preparing disclosures, reports, and other documents and of searching the art to make disclosures not required by the Federal award;
(ii) Costs in connection with filing and prosecuting any foreign patent application, or any United States patent application, where the Federal award does not require conveying title or a royalty-free license to the Federal Government.
(b)  (1) Royalties on a patent or copyright or amortization of the cost of acquiring by purchase a copyright, patent, or rights thereto, necessary for the proper performance of the Federal award are allowable unless:
Royalties and other costs for the use of patents and copyrights.(i) The Federal Government already has a license or the right to free use of the patent or copyright.
(ii) The patent or copyright has been adjudicated to be invalid or administratively determined to be invalid.
(iii) The patent or copyright is considered to be unenforceable.
(iv) The patent or copyright is expired.
(2) Special care should be exercised in determining reasonableness when the royalties may have been obtained as a result of less-than-arm's-length bargaining, such as:
(i) Royalties paid to persons, including corporations, affiliated with the recipient or subrecipient.
(ii) Royalties paid to unaffiliated parties, including corporations, under an agreement entered into in contemplation that a Federal award would be made.
(iii) Royalties paid under an agreement entered into after a Federal award is made to a recipient or subrecipient.
(3) In any case involving a patent or copyright formerly owned by the recipient or subrecipient, the amount of royalty allowed must not exceed the cost which would have been allowed had the recipient or subrecipient retained ownership.




200.449SECTION1§ 200.449   Interest.(a)  Costs incurred for interest on borrowed capital, temporary use of endowment funds, or the use of the recipient's or subrecipient's own funds are unallowable. Financing costs (including interest) to acquire, construct, or replace capital assets are allowable, subject to the requirements of this section.
General.(b)  (1) Capital assets is defined in § 200.1. An asset cost includes (as applicable) acquisition costs, construction costs, and other costs capitalized in accordance with GAAP.
Capital assets.(2) For recipient or subrecipient fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, intangible assets include patents and computer software. For software development projects, only interest attributable to the portion of the project costs capitalized in accordance with GAAP is allowable.
(c)  (1) The recipient or subrecipient uses the capital assets in support of Federal awards;
Requirements for all recipients and subrecipients.(2) The allowable asset costs to acquire facilities and equipment are limited to a fair market value available to the recipient or subrecipient from an unrelated (arm's length) third party.
(3) The recipient or subrecipient obtains the financing via an arm's-length transaction (meaning, a transaction with an unrelated third party); or claims reimbursement of actual interest cost at a rate available via such a transaction.
(4) The recipient or subrecipient limits claims for Federal reimbursement of interest costs to the least expensive alternative. For example, a lease contract that transfers ownership by the end of the contract may be determined less costly than purchasing through other types of debt financing, in which case reimbursement must be limited to the amount of interest determined if leasing had been used.
(5) The recipient or subrecipient expenses or capitalizes allowable interest cost in accordance with GAAP.
(6) Earnings generated by the investment of borrowed funds pending their disbursement for the asset costs are used to offset the current period's allowable interest cost, whether that cost is expensed or capitalized. Earnings subject to being reported to the Federal Internal Revenue Service under arbitrage requirements are excludable.
(7) The following conditions must apply to debt arrangements over $1 million to purchase or construct facilities unless the recipient or subrecipient makes an initial equity contribution to the purchase of 25 percent or more. For this purpose, “initial equity contribution” means the amount or value of contributions made by the recipient or subrecipient for the acquisition of facilities prior to occupancy.
(i) The recipient or subrecipient must reduce claims for reimbursement of interest cost by an amount equal to imputed interest earnings on excess cash flow attributable to the portion of the facility used for Federal awards.
(ii) The recipient or subrecipient must impute interest on excess cash flow as follows:
(A) Annually, the recipient or subrecipient must prepare a cumulative (from the project's inception) report of monthly cash inflows and outflows, regardless of the funding source. For this purpose, inflows consist of Federal reimbursement for depreciation, amortization of capitalized construction interest, and annual interest cost. Outflows consist of initial equity contributions, debt principal payments (less the pro-rata share attributable to the cost of land), and interest payments.
(B) To compute monthly cash inflows and outflows, the recipient or subrecipient must divide the above-mentioned annual amounts by the months in the year (usually 12) that the building is in service.
(C) For any month in which cumulative cash inflows exceed cumulative outflows, interest must be calculated on the excess inflows for that month and be treated as a reduction to allowable interest cost. The interest rate to be used must be the three-month Treasury bill closing rate as of the last business day of that month.
(8) Interest attributable to a fully depreciated asset is unallowable.
(d)  For interest costs to be allowable for states, local governments, and Indian Tribes, the recipient or subrecipient must have incurred the interest costs for buildings after October 1, 1980, or after September 1, 1995, for land and equipment.
Additional requirements for states, local governments and Indian Tribes.(1) The requirement to offset the interest earned on borrowed funds against allowable interest cost (paragraph (c)(5) of this section) also applies to earnings on debt service reserve funds.
(2) The recipient or subrecipient must negotiate the amount of allowable interest cost related to the acquisition of facilities with asset costs of $1 million or more, as described in paragraph (c)(7) of this section. For this purpose, a recipient or subrecipient must consider only cash inflows and outflows attributable to that portion of the real property used for Federal awards.
(e)  For interest costs to be allowable, the IHE must have incurred the interest costs after July 1, 1982, in connection with acquisitions of capital assets that occurred after that date.
Additional requirements for IHEs.(f)  For interest costs to be allowable, the nonprofit organization must have incurred the interest costs after September 29, 1995, in connection with acquisitions of capital assets that occurred after that date.
Additional requirements for nonprofit organizations.(g)  The interest allowability provisions of this section do not apply to a nonprofit organization subject to “full coverage” under the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), as defined at 48 CFR 9903.201-2(a). The nonprofit organization's Federal awards are instead subject to CAS 414 (48 CFR 9904.414), “Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Facilities Capital,” and CAS 417 (48 CFR 9904.417), “Cost of Money as an Element of the Cost of Capital Assets Under Construction.”




Requirements for nonprofit organizations subject to full coverage under CAS.200.450SECTION1§ 200.450   Lobbying.(a)  The costs of certain influencing activities associated with obtaining grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, or loans are unallowable. Lobbying with respect to certain grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and loans is governed by relevant statutes, including the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 1352, as well as the common rule, “New Restrictions on Lobbying,” published on February 26, 1990, including definitions, and the Office of Management and Budget “Government-wide Guidance for New Restrictions on Lobbying” and notices published on December 20, 1989, June 15, 1990, January 15, 1992, and January 19, 1996.
Lobbying costs associated with obtaining Federal assistance awards.(b)  Costs incurred in attempting to improperly influence, either directly or indirectly, an employee or officer of the executive branch of the Federal Government to give consideration or to act regarding a Federal award or a regulatory matter are unallowable. Improper influence means any influence that induces or tends to induce a Federal employee or officer to give consideration or to act regarding a Federal award or regulatory matter on any basis other than the merit.
Executive lobbying costs.(c)  In addition, the following restrictions apply to nonprofit organizations and IHEs:
Restrictions on nonprofit organizations and IHEs.(1) Costs associated with the following activities are unallowable:
(i) Attempts to influence the outcomes of any Federal, State, or local election, referendum, initiative, or similar procedure through in-kind or cash contributions, endorsements, publicity, or similar activity;
(ii) Establishing, administering, contributing to, or paying the expenses of a political party, campaign, political action committee, or other organization established to influence the outcomes of elections in the United States;
(iii) Any attempt to influence:
(A) The introduction of Federal or State legislation;
(B) The enactment or modification of any pending Federal or State legislation through communication with any member or employee of the Congress or State legislature (including efforts to influence State or local officials to engage in similar lobbying activity);
(C) The enactment or modification of any pending Federal or State legislation by preparing, distributing, or using publicity or propaganda or by urging members of the general public, or any segment thereof, to contribute to or participate in any mass demonstration, march, rally, fundraising drive, lobbying campaign or letter writing or telephone campaign; or
(D) Any government official or employee in connection with a decision to sign or veto enrolled legislation;
(iv) Legislative liaison activities, including attendance at legislative sessions or committee hearings, gathering information regarding legislation, and analyzing the effect of legislation, when such activities are carried on in support of or in knowing preparation for an effort to engage in unallowable lobbying.
(2) The following activities are excepted from the coverage of paragraph (c)(1) of this section:
(i) Technical and factual presentations on topics directly related to the performance of a grant, contract, or other agreement (through hearing testimony, statements, or letters to the Congress or a State legislature, or subdivision, member, or cognizant staff member thereof), in response to a documented request (including a Congressional Record notice requesting testimony or statements for the record at a regularly scheduled hearing) made by the recipient's or subrecipient's member of congress, legislative body, subdivision, or a cognizant staff member thereof, provided such information is readily obtainable and can be readily put in deliverable form, and further provided that costs under this section for travel, lodging or meals are unallowable unless incurred to offer testimony at a regularly scheduled Congressional hearing pursuant to a written request for such presentation made by the Chairman or Ranking Minority Member of the Committee or Subcommittee conducting such hearings;
(ii) Any lobbying made unallowable by paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section to influence State legislation to directly reduce the cost, or to avoid material impairment of the recipient's or subrecipient's authority to perform the grant, contract, or other agreement;
(iii) Any activity specifically authorized by statute to be undertaken with funds from the Federal award; or
(iv) Any activity excepted from the definitions of “lobbying” or “influencing legislation” by the Internal Revenue Code provisions that require nonprofit organizations to limit their participation in direct and “grass roots” lobbying activities to retain their charitable deduction status and avoid punitive excise taxes, 26 U.S.C. (I.R.C.) 501(c)(3), 501(h), 4911(a), including:
(A) Nonpartisan analysis, study, or research reports;
(B) Examinations and discussions of broad social, economic, and similar problems; and
(C) Information provided upon request by a legislator for technical advice and assistance, as defined by I.R.C. 4911(d)(2) and 26 CFR 56.4911-2(c)(1) through (c)(3).
(3) When a recipient or subrecipient seeks reimbursement for indirect costs, total lobbying costs must be identified separately in the indirect cost rate proposal and thereafter be treated as other unallowable activity costs in accordance with § 200.413.
(4) The recipient or subrecipient must submit a certification that the requirements and standards of this section have been complied with as part of its annual indirect cost rate proposal. (See § 200.415.)
(5)(i) Time logs, calendars, or similar records are not required to be created for purposes of complying with the record-keeping requirements in § 200.302 with respect to lobbying costs during a particular calendar month when:
(A) The employee engages in lobbying (as defined in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section) for 25 percent or less of the employee's compensated hours of employment during that calendar month; and
(B) Within the preceding five-year period, the recipient or subrecipient has not materially misstated allowable or unallowable costs of any nature, including legislative lobbying costs.
(ii) When conditions in paragraph (c)(5)(i)(A) and (B) of this section are met, recipients and subrecipients are not required to establish records to support the allowability of claimed costs in addition to records already required or maintained. Also, when conditions in paragraphs (c)(5)(i)(A) and (B) of this section are met, the absence of time logs, calendars, or similar records will not serve as a basis for disallowing costs by contesting estimates of lobbying time spent by employees during a calendar month.
(iii) In consultation with OMB, the Federal agency must establish procedures for resolving, in advance, any significant questions or disagreements concerning the interpretation or application of this section. Any such advance resolutions must be binding in any subsequent settlements, audits, or investigations with respect to that grant or contract for purposes of interpretation of this part, provided, however, that this must not be construed to prevent a contractor or recipient or subrecipient from contesting the lawfulness of such a determination.




200.451SECTION1§ 200.451   Losses on other awards or contracts.Any excess costs over income under any other award or contract of any nature is unallowable. This includes, but is not limited to, the recipient's or subrecipient's contributed portion by reason of cost sharing agreements or any under-recoveries through negotiation of flat amounts for indirect costs. Also, any excess of costs over authorized funding levels transferred from any award or contract to another is unallowable. All losses are not allowable indirect costs and must be included in the appropriate indirect cost rate base for allocating indirect costs.




200.452SECTION1§ 200.452   Maintenance and repair costs.Costs incurred for utilities, insurance, security, necessary maintenance, janitorial services, repair, or upkeep of buildings and equipment (including Federal property unless otherwise provided for) which neither add to the permanent value of the property nor appreciably prolong its intended life, but keep it in an efficient operating condition, are allowable. Costs incurred for improvements that add to the permanent value of the buildings and equipment or appreciably prolong their intended life must be treated as capital expenditures (see § 200.439). These costs are only allowable to the extent not paid through rental or other agreements.




200.453SECTION1§ 200.453   Materials and supplies costs, including costs of computing devices.(a) Costs incurred for materials, supplies, and fabricated parts necessary for the performance of a Federal award are allowable.
(b) Purchased materials and supplies must be charged at their actual prices, net of applicable credits. Withdrawals from general stores or stockrooms must be charged at their actual net cost under any recognized method of pricing inventory withdrawals, consistently applied. Incoming transportation charges are an allowable part of materials and supplies costs.
(c) Materials and supplies used for the performance of a Federal award may be charged as direct costs. Charging computing devices as direct costs is allowable for devices that are essential and allocable, but not solely dedicated, to the performance of a Federal award.
(d) Where Federally-donated or furnished materials are used in performing the Federal award, the materials will be used without charge.




200.454SECTION1§ 200.454   Memberships, subscriptions, and professional activity costs.(a) Costs of the recipient's or subrecipient's membership in business, technical, and professional organizations are allowable.
(b) Costs of the recipient's or subrecipient's subscriptions to business, professional, and technical periodicals are allowable.
(c) Costs of membership in any civic or community organization are allowable.
(d) Costs of membership in any country club or social or dining club or organization are unallowable.
(e) Costs of membership in organizations whose primary purpose is lobbying are unallowable. See § 200.450.




200.455SECTION1§ 200.455   Organization costs.(a) Costs such as incorporation fees, brokers' fees, fees to promoters, organizers or management consultants, attorneys, accountants, or investment counselors, whether or not employees of the recipient or subrecipient in connection with the establishment or reorganization of an organization, are unallowable except with prior approval of the Federal agency.
(b) The costs of any of the following activities are unallowable: activities undertaken to persuade employees of the recipient or subrecipient, or any other entity, to exercise or not to exercise, or concerning the manner of exercising, the right to organize and bargain collectively through representatives of the employees' own choosing.
(c) The costs related to data and evaluation are allowable. Data costs include (but are not limited to) the expenditures needed to gather, store, track, manage, analyze, disaggregate, secure, share, publish, or otherwise use data to administer or improve the program, such as data systems, personnel, data dashboards, cybersecurity, and related items. Data costs may also include direct or indirect costs associated with building integrated data systems—data systems that link individual-level data from multiple State and local government agencies for purposes of management, research, and evaluation. Evaluation costs include (but are not limited to) evidence reviews, evaluation planning and feasibility assessment, conducting evaluations, sharing evaluation results, and other personnel or materials costs related to the effective building and use of evidence and evaluation for program design, administration, or improvement.




200.456SECTION1§ 200.456   Participant support costs.Participant support costs are allowable (see § 200.1 The classification of items as participant support costs must be documented in the recipient's or subrecipient's written policies and procedures and treated consistently across all Federal awards.




).200.457SECTION1§ 200.457   Plant and security costs.Necessary and reasonable expenses incurred for the protection and security of facilities, personnel, and work products are allowable. Such costs include, but are not limited to, wages and uniforms of personnel engaged in security activities; equipment; barriers; protective (non-military) gear, devices, and equipment; contractual security services; and consultants. Capital expenditures for plant security purposes are subject to § 200.439.




200.458SECTION1§ 200.458   Pre-award costs.Pre-award costs are those incurred before the start date of the Federal award or subaward directly pursuant to the negotiation and in anticipation of the Federal award where such costs are necessary for efficient and timely performance of the scope of work. These costs are allowable only to the extent that they would have been allowed if incurred after the start date of the Federal award and only with the written approval of the Federal agency. If approved, these costs must be charged to the initial budget period of the Federal award unless otherwise specified by the Federal agency or pass-through entity.




200.459SECTION1§ 200.459   Professional service costs.(a) Costs of professional and consultant services rendered by persons who are members of a particular profession or possess a special skill and who are not officers or employees of the recipient or subrecipient are allowable, subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section when reasonable in relation to the services rendered and when not contingent upon recovery of the costs from the Federal Government. In addition, legal and related services are limited under § 200.435.
(b) In determining the allowability of costs in a particular case, no single factor or any combination of factors is necessarily determinative. However, the following factors are relevant:
(1) The nature and scope of the service rendered in relation to the service required.
(2) The necessity of contracting for the service, considering the recipient's or subrecipient's capability in the particular area.
(3) The past pattern of such costs, particularly in the years prior to receiving a Federal award(s).
(4) The impact of Federal awards on the recipient's or subrecipient's business (meaning, what new problems have arisen).
(5) Whether the proportion of Federal work to the recipient's or subrecipient's total business influences the recipient or subrecipient in favor of incurring the cost, particularly where the services rendered are not of a continuing nature and have little relationship to work under Federal awards.
(6) Whether the service can be performed more economically by direct employment rather than contracting.
(7) The qualifications of the individual or entity providing the service and the customary fees charged, especially on non-federally funded activities.
(8) Adequacy of the contractual agreement for the service (for example, description of the service, estimate of the time required, rate of compensation, and termination provisions).
(c) To be allowable, retainer fees must be supported by evidence of bona fide services available or rendered in addition to the factors in paragraph (b) of this section.


200.460SECTION1§ 200.460   Proposal costs.Proposal costs are the costs of preparing bids, proposals, or applications on potential Federal and non-Federal awards or projects, including developing data necessary to support the recipient's or subrecipient's bids or proposals. Proposal costs of the current accounting period of both successful and unsuccessful bids and proposals normally should be treated as indirect costs and allocated to all current activities of the recipient or subrecipient. No proposal costs of past accounting periods may be allocated to the current period.




200.461SECTION1§ 200.461   Publication and printing costs.(a) Publication costs for electronic and print media, including distribution, promotion, and general handling, are allowable. These costs should be allocated as indirect costs to all benefiting activities of the recipient or subrecipient if they are not identifiable with a particular cost objective.
(b) Page charges, article processing charges (APCs), or similar fees such as open access fees for professional journal publications and other peer-reviewed publications resulting from a Federal award are allowable where:
(1) The publications report work supported by the Federal Government; and
(2) The charges are levied impartially on all items published by the journal, whether or not under a Federal award.
(3) The recipient or subrecipient may charge the Federal award during closeout for the costs of publication or sharing of research results if the costs were not incurred during the period of performance of the Federal award. These costs must be charged to the final budget period of the award unless otherwise specified by the Federal agency.




200.462SECTION1§ 200.462   Rearrangement and reconversion costs.(a) Costs incurred for ordinary and normal rearrangement and alteration of facilities are allowable as indirect costs. Special arrangements and alterations are allowable as a direct cost if the costs are incurred specifically for a Federal award and with the prior approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity.
(b) Costs incurred in restoring or rehabilitating the recipient's or subrecipient's facilities to approximately the same condition existing immediately before the commencement of a Federal award(s), less costs related to normal wear and tear, are allowable.




200.463SECTION1§ 200.463   Recruiting costs.(a) Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, and provided that the size of the staff recruited and maintained is in keeping with workload requirements, costs of “help wanted” advertising, operating costs of an employment office necessary to secure and maintain adequate staff, costs of operating an aptitude and educational testing program, travel costs of employees while engaged in recruiting personnel, travel costs of applicants for interviews for prospective employment, and relocation costs incurred incident to recruitment of new employees, are allowable to the extent that such costs are incurred pursuant to the recipient's or subrecipient's standard recruitment program. When the recipient or subrecipient uses employment agencies, costs not in excess of standard commercial rates for such services are allowable.
(b) Special emoluments, fringe benefits, and salary allowances incurred to attract professional personnel that do not meet the test of reasonableness or do not conform with the established practices of the recipient or subrecipient, are unallowable.
(c) If relocation costs incurred incident to recruitment of a new employee have been funded in whole or in part by a Federal award, and the newly hired employee resigns for reasons within the employee's control within 12 months after hire, the recipient or subrecipient must refund or credit the Federal Government for its share of those relocation costs. See § 200.464.
(d) Short-term visas (as opposed to longer-term immigration visas) are generally an allowable cost and they may be proposed as a direct cost because they are issued for a specific period and purpose and can be clearly identified as directly connected to work performed on a Federal award. For these costs to be directly charged to a Federal award, they must:
(1) Be critical and necessary for the conduct of the project;
(2) Be allowable under the applicable cost principles;
(3) Be consistent with the recipient's or subrecipient's cost accounting practices and established written policy; and
(4) Meet the definition of “direct cost” as described in the applicable cost principles.




200.464SECTION1§ 200.464   Relocation costs of employees.(a) Relocation costs are costs incident to the permanent change of duty assignment (for an indefinite period or a stated period of not less than 12 months) of an existing employee or upon recruitment of a new employee. Relocation costs are allowable, subject to the limitations described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, provided that:
(1) The move is for the benefit of the employer.
(2) Reimbursement to the employee is in accordance with an established written policy consistently followed by the employer.
(3) The reimbursement does not exceed the employee's actual (or reasonably estimated) expenses.
(b) Allowable relocation costs for current employees are limited to the following:
(1) The costs of transportation of the employee, members of their immediate family and their household, and personal effects to the new location.
(2) The costs of finding a new home, such as advance trips by employees and spouses to locate living quarters and temporary lodging during the transition period, up to a maximum period of 30 calendar days.
(3) Closing costs, such as brokerage, legal, and appraisal fees, incidental to the disposition of the employee's former home. These costs, together with those described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, are limited to eight percent of the sales price of the employee's former home.
(4) The continuing costs of ownership (for up to six months) of the vacant former home after the settlement or lease date of the employee's new permanent home, such as maintenance of buildings and grounds (exclusive of fixing-up expenses), utilities, taxes, and property insurance.
(5) Other necessary and reasonable expenses normally incident to relocation, such as canceling an unexpired lease, transportation of personal property, and purchasing insurance against loss of or damages to personal property. The cost of canceling an unexpired lease is limited to three times the monthly rental.
(c) Allowable relocation costs for new employees are limited to those described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section. If relocation costs incurred incident to the recruitment of a new employee have been funded in whole or in part by a Federal award, and the newly hired employee resigns for reasons within the employee's control within 12 months after hire, the recipient or subrecipient must refund or credit the Federal Government for its share of the cost. If a new employee is relocating to an overseas location and dependents are not permitted for any reason, and the costs do not include transporting household goods, the costs must be considered travel costs in accordance with § 200.474 this section.
, not relocation costs under(d) The following costs related to relocation are unallowable:
(1) Fees and other costs associated with acquiring a new home.
(2) A loss on the sale of a former home.
(3) Continuing mortgage principal and interest payments on a home being sold.
(4) Income taxes paid by an employee related to reimbursed relocation costs.




200.465SECTION1§ 200.465   Rental costs of real property and equipment.(a) Subject to the limitations described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, rental costs are allowable to the extent that the rates are reasonable in light of such factors as costs of comparable rental properties; market conditions in the area; alternatives available; and the type, life expectancy, condition, and value of the property leased. Rental arrangements should be reviewed periodically to determine if circumstances have changed and if other options are available.
(b) Rental costs under “sale and lease back” arrangements are allowable only up to the amount that would have been allowed if the recipient or subrecipient had continued to own the property. This amount would include expenses such as depreciation, maintenance, taxes, and insurance.
(c) Rental costs under “less-than-arm's-length” leases are allowable only up to the amount described in paragraph (b) of this section. For this purpose, a less-than-arm's-length lease is one under which one party to the lease agreement can control or substantially influence the actions of the other. Such leases include, but are not limited to, those between:
(1) Divisions of the recipient or subrecipient;
(2) The recipient or subrecipient and another entity under common control through common officers, directors, or members; and
(3) The recipient or subrecipient and a director, trustee, officer, or key employee of the recipient or subrecipient or an immediate family member, either directly or through corporations, trusts, or similar arrangements in which they hold a controlling interest. For example, the recipient or subrecipient may establish a separate corporation to own property and lease it back to the recipient or subrecipient.
(4) Family members include one party with any of the following relationships to another party:
(i) Spouse and parents thereof;
(ii) Children and spouses thereof;
(iii) Parents and spouses thereof;
(iv) Siblings and spouses thereof;
(v) Grandparents and grandchildren and spouses thereof;
(vi) Domestic partner and parents thereof, including domestic partners of any individual in 2 through 5 of this definition; and
(vii) Any individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship.
(d) Rental costs under leases which are required to be accounted for as a financed purchase under GASB standards or a finance lease under FASB standards are allowable only up to the amount (described in paragraph (b) of this section) that would have been allowed if the recipient or subrecipient had purchased the property on the date the lease agreement was executed. Interest costs related to these leases are allowable if they meet the criteria in § 200.449. Unallowable costs include costs that would not have been incurred if the recipient or subrecipient had purchased the property, such as amounts paid for profit, management fees, and taxes.
(e) Rental or lease payments are allowable under lease contracts where the recipient or subrecipient is required to recognize an intangible right-to-use lease asset under GASB standards or right-of-use operating lease asset under FASB standards for purposes of financial reporting in accordance with GAAP.
(f) The rental of any property owned by any individuals or entities affiliated with the recipient or subrecipient, including commercial or residential real estate, for purposes such as the home office is unallowable.




200.466SECTION1§ 200.466   Scholarships, student aid costs, and tuition remission.(a) Costs of scholarships, fellowships, and student aid programs at IHEs are allowable only when the purpose of the Federal award is to provide training to participants, and the Federal agency approves the cost.
(b) Tuition remission and other forms of compensation paid as, or instead of, wages to students performing necessary work are allowable provided that:
(1) The individual is conducting activities necessary to the Federal award;
(2) Tuition remission and other support are provided in accordance with the established written policy of the IHE and consistently provided in a like manner to students in return for similar activities conducted under Federal awards as well as other activities; and
(3) The student is enrolled in an advanced degree program at the IHE or an affiliated institution during the academic period and the student's activities under the Federal award are related to their degree program;
(4) The tuition or other payments are reasonable compensation for the work performed and are conditioned explicitly upon the performance of necessary work; and
(5) The IHE compensates students under Federal awards as well as other activities in similar manners.
(c) Charges for tuition remission and other forms of compensation paid to students as, or instead of, salaries and wages are subject to the reporting requirements in § 200.430. The charges must be treated as a direct or indirect cost in accordance with the actual work performed. Tuition remission may be charged on an average rate basis. See § 200.431.




200.467SECTION1§ 200.467   Selling and marketing costs.Costs of selling and marketing any products or services of the recipient or subrecipient are unallowable unless they are allowed under § 200.421




 and are necessary to meet the requirements of the Federal award.200.468SECTION1§ 200.468   Specialized service facilities.(a) The costs of services provided by highly complex or specialized facilities operated by the recipient or subrecipient are allowable provided the charges for the services meet the conditions of either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section take into account any items of income or Federal financing that qualify as applicable credits under § 200.406. These costs include charges for facilities such as computing facilities, wind tunnels, and reactors.
 and(b) The costs of such services, when material, must be charged directly to the applicable Federal awards based on actual usage of the services on the basis of a schedule of rates or established methodology that:
(1) Does not discriminate between activities under Federal awards and other activities of the recipient or subrecipient, including usage by the recipient or subrecipient for internal purposes; and
(2) Is designed to recover only the aggregate costs of the services. Each service's costs must normally consist of its direct costs and an allocable share of all indirect costs. Rates must be adjusted at least biennially and must consider any over or under-applied costs of the previous period(s).
(c) Where the costs incurred for a service are not material, they may be allocated as indirect costs.
(d) Under extraordinary circumstances, the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the recipient or subrecipient may negotiate and establish an alternative costing arrangement if it is in the Federal Government's best interest.




200.469SECTION1§ 200.469   Student activity costs.Costs incurred for intramural activities, student publications, student clubs, and other student activities are unallowable unless expressly authorized in the Federal award.




200.470SECTION1§ 200.470   Taxes (including Value Added Tax).(a)  (1) Taxes that a governmental unit is legally required to pay are allowable, except for self-assessed taxes that disproportionately affect Federal programs or changes in tax policies that disproportionately affect Federal programs.
For States, local governments, and Indian Tribes.(2) Gasoline taxes, motor vehicle fees, and other taxes that are, in effect, user fees for benefits provided to the Federal Government are allowable.
(3) This provision does not restrict the authority of the Federal agency to identify taxes where Federal participation is inappropriate. The cognizant agency for indirect costs may accept a reasonable approximation in circumstances where determining the amount of unallowable taxes would require an excessive amount of effort.
(b)  (1) Taxes that the recipient or subrecipient is required to pay and which are paid or accrued in accordance with GAAP are generally allowable. These costs include payments made to local governments instead of taxes and that are commensurate with the local government services received. The following taxes are unallowable:
For nonprofit organizations and IHEs.(i) Taxes for which exemptions are available to the recipient or subrecipient directly or which are available to the recipient or subrecipient based on an exemption afforded the Federal Government and, in the latter case, when the Federal agency makes available the necessary exemption certificates;
(ii) Special assessments on land which represent capital improvements; and
(iii) Federal income taxes.
(2) Any refund of taxes and interest thereon, which were allowed as Federal award costs, must be credited to the Federal Government as a cost reduction or cash refund, as appropriate. However, any interest paid or credited to a recipient or subrecipient incident to a refund of tax, interest, and penalty will be paid or credited to the Federal Government only to the extent that such interest accrued over the period during which the Federal Government has reimbursed the recipient or subrecipient for the taxes, interest, and penalties.
(c)  Foreign taxes charged for procurement transactions that a recipient or subrecipient is legally required to pay in a country are allowable. Foreign tax refunds or applicable credits under Federal awards refer to receipts or reduction of expenditures, which operate to offset or reduce expense items that are allocable to Federal awards as direct or indirect costs. To the extent that such credits accrued or received by the recipient or subrecipient relate to allowable cost, these costs must be credited to the Federal agency as a cost reduction or cash refunds, as appropriate. In cases where the costs are credited back to the Federal award, the recipient or subrecipient may reduce the Federal share of costs by the amount of the foreign tax reimbursement, or where Federal award has not expired, the Federal agency may allow the recipient or subrecipient to use the foreign government tax refund for approved activities under the Federal award.




Value Added Tax (VAT).200.471SECTION1§ 200.471   Telecommunication and video surveillance costs.(a) Costs incurred for telecommunications and video surveillance services or equipment such as phones, internet, video surveillance, and cloud servers are allowable except for the following circumstances:
(b) Obligating or expending covered telecommunications and video surveillance services or equipment or services as described in § 200.216 to:
(1) Procure or obtain, extend or renew a contract to procure or obtain;
(2) Enter into a contract (or extend or renew a contract) to procure; or
(3) Obtain the equipment, services, or systems.




200.472SECTION1§ 200.472   Termination and standard closeout costs.(a)  Termination of a Federal award generally gives rise to the incurrence of costs or the need for special treatment of costs, which would not have arisen had the Federal award not been terminated. Cost principles covering these items are set forth in this section. They must be used in conjunction with the other termination requirements of this part.
Termination Costs.(1) The cost of items reasonably usable on the recipient's or subrecipient's other work is unallowable unless the recipient or subrecipient submits evidence that it would not retain such items without sustaining a loss. In deciding whether such items are reasonably usable on other work of the recipient or subrecipient, the Federal agency or pass-through entity should consider the recipient's or subrecipient's plans and orders for current and scheduled activity. Contemporaneous purchases of common items by the recipient or subrecipient must be considered evidence that the items are reasonably usable on the recipient's or subrecipient's other work. Any acceptance of common items as allocable to the terminated portion of the Federal award must be limited to the extent that the quantities of such items on hand, in transit, and on order do not exceed the reasonable quantitative requirements of other work.
(2) If the recipient or subrecipient cannot discontinue certain costs immediately after the effective termination date, despite making all reasonable efforts, then the costs are generally allowable within the limitations of this part. Any costs continuing after termination due to the negligent or willful failure of the recipient or subrecipient to immediately discontinue the costs are unallowable.
(3) Loss of useful value of special tooling, machinery, and equipment is generally allowable if:
(i) Such special tooling, special machinery, or equipment is not reasonably capable of use in the other work of the recipient or subrecipient;
(ii) The interest of the Federal Government is protected by transfer of title or by other means deemed appropriate by the Federal agency (see § 200.313 (d)); and
(iii) The loss of useful value for any one terminated Federal award is limited to the portion of the acquisition cost which bears the same ratio to the total acquisition cost as the terminated portion of the Federal award bears to the entire terminated Federal award and other Federal awards for which the special tooling, machinery, or equipment was acquired.
(4) If paragraph (a)(4)(i) and (ii) below are satisfied, rental costs under unexpired leases (less the residual value of such leases) are generally allowable where clearly shown to have been reasonably necessary for the performance of the terminated Federal award. These rental costs may include the cost of alterations of the leased property and the cost of reasonable restoration required by the lease, provided the alterations were necessary for the performance of the Federal award.
(i) The amount of claimed rental costs does not exceed the reasonable use value of the property leased for the period of the Federal award and a further period as may be reasonable; and
(ii) The recipient or subrecipient makes all reasonable efforts to terminate, assign, settle, or otherwise reduce the cost of the lease.
(5) The following settlement expenses are generally allowable.
(i) Accounting, legal, clerical, and similar costs that are reasonably necessary for:
(A) The preparation and presentation to the Federal agency or pass-through entity of settlement claims and supporting data with respect to the terminated portion of the Federal award, unless the termination is for cause (see §§ 200.339-200.343); and
(B) The termination and settlement of subawards.
(ii) Reasonable costs for the storage, transportation, protection, and disposition of property provided by the Federal Government or acquired or produced for the Federal award.
(6) Claims under subawards, including the allocable portion of claims common to the Federal award and other work of the recipient or subrecipient, are generally allowable. An appropriate share of the recipient's or subrecipient's indirect costs may be allocated to the amount of settlements with contractors and subrecipients, provided that the amount allocated is consistent with the requirements of § 200.414. These allocated indirect costs must exclude the same and similar costs claimed directly or indirectly as settlement expenses.
(b)  Administrative costs associated with the closeout activities of a Federal award are allowable. The recipient or subrecipient may charge the Federal award during the closeout for the necessary administrative costs of that Federal award (for example, salaries of personnel preparing final reports, publication and printing costs, costs associated with the disposition of equipment and property, and related indirect costs). These costs may be incurred until the due date of the final report(s). If incurred, these costs must be liquidated prior to the due date of the final report(s) and charged to the final budget period of the award unless otherwise specified by the Federal agency.






Closeout Costs.200.473SECTION1§ 200.473   Training and education costs.The cost of training and education provided for employee development is allowable.




200.474SECTION1§ 200.474   Transportation costs.Costs incurred for freight, express, cartage, postage, and other transportation services relating to goods purchased, in process, or delivered, are allowable. When the costs can be readily identified with the items involved, they may be charged directly as transportation costs or added to the cost of such items. When identification with the materials received cannot be readily made, the inbound transportation cost may be charged to the appropriate indirect cost accounts if the recipient or subrecipient follows a consistent, equitable procedure in this respect. If reimbursable under the terms and conditions of the Federal award, outbound freight should be treated as a direct cost.




200.475SECTION1§ 200.475   Travel costs.(a)  Travel costs include the transportation, lodging, subsistence, and related items incurred by employees who are in travel status on official business of the recipient or subrecipient. These costs may be charged on an actual cost basis, on a per diem or mileage basis, or on a combination of the two, provided the method used is applied to an entire trip and not to selected days of the trip. The method used must be consistent with those normally allowed in like circumstances in the recipient's or subrecipient's other activities and in accordance with the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policies. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 200.444, travel costs of officials covered by that section are allowable with the prior written approval of the Federal agency or pass-through entity when they are specifically related to the Federal award.
General.(b)  Costs incurred by employees and officers for travel, including costs of lodging, other subsistence, and incidental expenses, must be considered reasonable and otherwise allowable only to the extent such costs do not exceed charges normally allowed by the recipient or subrecipient in its regular operations as the result of the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policy. In addition, if these costs are charged directly to the Federal award documentation must justify that:
Lodging and subsistence.(1) Participation of the individual is necessary for the Federal award; and
(2) The costs are reasonable and consistent with the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policy.
(c)  (1) Temporary dependent care costs (dependent is defined in 26 U.S.C. 152) above and beyond regular dependent care are allowable provided that these costs:
Dependents.(i) Are a direct result of the individual's travel to a conference for the Federal award;
(ii) Are consistent with the recipient's or subrecipient's established written policy for all travel; and
(iii) Are only temporary during the travel period.
(2) Travel costs for dependents are unallowable, except for travel of six months or more with prior approval of the Federal agency. See § 200.432.
(d)  In the absence of an established written policy regarding travel costs, the rates and amounts established under 5 U.S.C. 5701-11 (“Travel and Subsistence Expenses; Mileage Allowances”), by the Administrator of General Services, or by the President (or their designee) pursuant to any provisions of such subchapter must apply to travel under Federal awards (48 CFR 31.205-46(a)).
Establishing rates and amounts.(e)  (1) Airfare costs in excess of the basic least expensive unrestricted accommodations class offered by commercial airlines are unallowable except when such accommodations would:
Commercial air travel.(i) Require circuitous routing;
(ii) Require travel during unreasonable hours;
(iii) Excessively prolong travel;
(iv) Result in additional costs that would offset the transportation savings; or
(v) Offer accommodations not reasonably adequate for the traveler's medical needs. The recipient or subrecipient must justify and document these conditions on a case-by-case basis for the use of first-class or business-class airfare to be allowable in such cases.
(2) Unless a pattern of avoidance is detected, the Federal Government will generally not question a recipient's or subrecipient's determinations that customary standard airfare or other discount airfare is unavailable for specific trips if the recipient or subrecipient can demonstrate that such airfare was not available in the specific case.
(f)  Travel costs by recipient or subrecipient-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft include the cost of the lease, charter, operation (including personnel costs), maintenance, depreciation, insurance, and other related costs. The portion of these costs that exceeds the cost of airfare, as provided for in paragraph (d), is unallowable.




Air travel by other than commercial carrier.200.476SECTION1§ 200.476   Trustees.Travel and subsistence costs of trustees (or directors) at IHEs and nonprofit organizations are allowable. See § 200.475.


FSUBPARTSubpart F—Audit RequirementsECFR7259014ad82dcd8SUBJGRPGeneral200.500SECTION1§ 200.500   Purpose.This part sets forth standards for obtaining consistency and uniformity among Federal agencies for the audit of non-Federal entities expending Federal awards.


ECFRfd0932e473d10baSUBJGRPAudits200.501SECTION1§ 200.501   Audit requirements.(a)  A non-Federal entity that expends $1,000,000 or more during the non-Federal entity's fiscal year in Federal awards must have a single or program-specific audit conducted for that year in accordance with the provisions of this part.
Audit required.(b)  A non-Federal entity that expends $1,000,000 or more in Federal awards during the non-Federal entity's fiscal year must have a single audit conducted in accordance with § 200.514 except when it elects to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.
Single audit.(c)  A non-Federal entity may elect to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with § 200.507 if the following conditions are met:
Program-specific audit election (in general).(1) The non-Federal entity expends Federal awards under only one Federal program (excluding research and development); and
(2) The Federal program's statutes or regulations, or terms and conditions of the Federal award, do not require a financial statement audit of the non-Federal entity.
(d)  A non-Federal entity may elect to have a program-specific audit for research and development conducted in accordance with § 200.507, but only if all of the following conditions are met:
Program-specific audit election for research and development.(1) The non-Federal entity expends Federal awards only from the same Federal agency, or the same Federal agency and the same pass-through entity; and
(2) The Federal agency, or pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient, approves a program-specific audit in advance.
(e)  A non-Federal entity that expends less than $1,000,000 in Federal awards during its fiscal year is exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted in § 200.503. However, in all instances, the records of the non-Federal entity must be available for review or audit by appropriate officials of the Federal agency, pass-through entity, and the Government Accountability Office (GAO).
Exemption when Federal awards expended are less than $1,000,000.(f)  Management of an auditee that owns or operates a FFRDC may elect to treat the FFRDC as a separate entity for purposes of this part.
Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC).(g)  An auditee may simultaneously be a recipient, a subrecipient, and a contractor. Unless a program is exempt by Federal statute, Federal awards expended as a recipient or a subrecipient are subject to audit under this part. Payments received for goods or services provided as a contractor under a Federal award (see § 200.331) are not subject to audit under this part.
Subrecipients and contractors.(h)  In most cases, the auditee's compliance responsibility for contractors is to ensure that the procurement, receipt, and payment for goods and services comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of a Federal award. Federal award compliance requirements normally do not flow down to contractors. However, for procurement transactions in which the contractor is made responsible for meeting program requirements, the auditee must ensure those requirements are met, including by clearly stating the contractor's responsibilities within the contract and reviewing the contractor's records to determine compliance. Also, when these procurement transactions relate to a major program, the scope of the audit must include a determination of whether these transactions comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of a Federal award. See also § 200.318(b).
Compliance responsibility for contractors.(i)  This subpart does not apply to for-profit organizations. As necessary, the pass-through entity is responsible for establishing requirements to ensure compliance by for-profit subrecipients. The subaward with a for-profit subrecipient must describe applicable compliance requirements and the for-profit subrecipient's compliance responsibility. Methods to ensure compliance for Federal awards made to for-profit subrecipients may include pre-award audits, monitoring throughout the performance of the subaward, and post-award audits (see § 200.332).




For-profit subrecipient.200.502SECTION1§ 200.502   Basis for determining Federal awards expended.(a)  The determination of when a Federal award is expended must be based on when the activity related to the Federal award occurs. Generally, the activity related to the Federal award pertains to events that require the non-Federal entity to comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards, such as:
Determining Federal awards expended.(1) Expenditure/expense transactions associated with grants, cooperative agreements, cost-reimbursement contracts under the FAR, compacts with Indian Tribes, and direct appropriations;
(2) The disbursement of funds to subrecipients;
(3) The use of loan proceeds under loan and loan guarantee programs;
(4) The receipt of property (including surplus property);
(5) The receipt or use of program income;
(6) The distribution or use of food commodities;
(7) The disbursement of amounts entitling the non-Federal entity to an interest subsidy; and
(8) The period when insurance is in force.
(b)  The Federal Government is at risk for loans until the debt is repaid. Therefore, the following guidelines must be used to calculate the value of Federal awards expended under loan programs (except as noted in paragraphs (c) and (d)):
Loan and loan guarantees (loans).(1) The value of new loans made or received during the audit period; plus
(2) The balance of loans from previous years at the beginning of the audit period for which the Federal Government imposes continuing compliance requirements; plus
(3) Any interest subsidy, cash, or administrative cost allowance received.
(c)  When loans are made to students of an IHE, but the IHE itself does not have continuing compliance requirements for the loans, then only the value of loans made during the audit period are considered Federal awards expended in that audit period. The balance of loans for previous audit periods is not included as Federal awards expended because the lender accounts for the prior balances.
Loan and loan guarantees (loans) at Institutions of Higher Education (IHE).(d)  Loans, the proceeds of which were received and expended in prior years, are not considered Federal awards expended under this part when Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards pertaining to such loans impose no continuing compliance requirements other than to repay the loans.
Prior loan and loan guarantees (loans).(e)  The cumulative balance of Federal awards for endowment funds that are federally restricted is considered Federal awards expended in each audit period in which the funds are still restricted.
Endowment funds.(f)  Free rent received by itself is not considered a Federal award expended under this part. However, free rent received as part of a Federal award to carry out a Federal program must be included in determining Federal awards expended and is subject to audit under this part.
Free rent.(g)  Federal non-cash assistance (such as free rent, food commodities, donated property, or donated surplus property that is received as part of a Federal award to carry out a Federal program) must be valued at fair market value at the time of receipt or the assessed value provided by the Federal agency and must be included in determining Federal awards expended under this part.
Valuing non-cash assistance.(h)  Medicare payments to a non-Federal entity for providing patient care services to Medicare-eligible individuals are not considered Federal awards expended under this part.
Medicare.(i)  Medicaid payments to a subrecipient for providing patient care services to Medicaid-eligible individuals are not considered Federal awards expended under this part unless a State requires the funds to be treated as Federal awards expended because reimbursement is on a cost-reimbursement basis.
Medicaid.(j)  For purposes of this part, loans from the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund and the Central Liquidity Facility funded by contributions from insured non-Federal entities are not considered Federal awards expended.




Certain loans provided by the National Credit Union Administration.200.503SECTION1§ 200.503   Relation to other audit requirements.(a)  An audit conducted in accordance with this part must be in lieu of any financial audit of Federal awards which a non-Federal entity is required to undergo under any other Federal statute or regulation. To the extent that such an audit provides a Federal agency with the information it requires to carry out its responsibilities under Federal statute or regulation, a Federal agency must rely upon and use that information.
Other financial audits.(b)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a Federal agency, Inspectors General, or GAO may conduct or arrange additional audits to carry out its responsibilities under Federal statute or regulation. The provisions of this part do not authorize any non-Federal entity to constrain, in any manner, such Federal agency from carrying out or arranging for such additional audits, except that the Federal agency must plan such audits not to be duplicative of other audits of Federal awards. Prior to commencing such an audit, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must review the FAC for recent audits submitted by the non-Federal entity, and to the extent such audits meet a Federal agency or pass-through entity's needs, the Federal agency or pass-through entity must rely upon and use such audits. Any additional audits must be planned and performed in such a way as to build upon work performed, including the audit documentation, sampling, and testing already performed by other auditors.
Conducting additional audits.(c)  The provisions of this part do not limit the authority of Federal agencies to conduct, or arrange for the conduct of, audits and evaluations of Federal awards, nor limit the authority of any Federal agency Inspector General or other Federal officials. For example, requirements that may be applicable under the FAR or CAS and the terms and conditions of a cost-reimbursement contract may include additional applicable audits to be conducted or arranged for by Federal agencies.
Authority to conduct additional audits.(d)  A Federal agency that conducts or arranges for additional audits must, consistent with other applicable Federal statutes and regulations, arrange for funding the full cost of such additional audits.
Federal agency to pay for additional audits.(e)  A Federal agency may request that an auditee have a particular Federal program audited as a major program in lieu of the Federal agency conducting or arranging for the additional audits. Such requests should be made at least 180 calendar days prior to the end of the fiscal year to be audited to allow for planning. After consultation with its auditor, the auditee should promptly respond to such a request by informing the Federal agency whether the program would otherwise be audited as a major program using the risk-based audit approach described in § 200.518 and, if not, the estimated incremental cost. The Federal agency must then promptly confirm to the auditee whether it wants the program audited as a major program. If the program is to be audited as a major program based upon this Federal agency request, and the Federal agency agrees to pay the full incremental costs, then the auditee must have the program audited as a major program. With approval of the Federal agency, a pass-through entity may use the provisions of this paragraph for a subrecipient.




Request for a program to be audited as a major program.200.504SECTION1§ 200.504   Frequency of audits.Audits required by this part must be performed annually unless biennial audits are permitted under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. Biennial audits must cover both fiscal years within the biennial period.
(a) A State, local government, or Indian Tribe that is required by constitution or statute, in effect on January 1, 1987, to undergo its audits less frequently than annually, is permitted to undergo biennial (every other year) audits pursuant to this part. This requirement must still be in effect for the biennial period.
(b) Any nonprofit organization that had biennial audits for all biennial periods ending between July 1, 1992, and January 1, 1995, is permitted to undergo biennial audits pursuant to this part.




200.505SECTION1§ 200.505   Remedies for audit noncompliance.In cases of continued inability or unwillingness of a non-federal entity to have an audit conducted in accordance with this part, Federal agencies or pass-through entities must take appropriate action as provided in § 200.339.

ECFRc3bd6ae97de5a40SUBJGRPAuditees200.508SECTION1§ 200.508   Auditee responsibilities.The auditee must:
(a) Arrange for the audit required by this part in accordance with § 200.509, and ensure it is properly performed and submitted in accordance with § 200.512.
(b) Prepare financial statements, including the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards in accordance with § 200.510.
(c) Promptly follow up and take corrective action on audit findings. This includes preparing a summary schedule of prior audit findings and a corrective action plan in accordance with § 200.511(b) and (c), respectively.
(d) Provide the auditor access to personnel, accounts, books, records, supporting documentation, and any other information needed for the auditor to perform the audit required by this part.




200.509SECTION1§ 200.509   Auditor selection.(a)  When procuring audit services, the auditee must follow the procurement standards in §§ 200.317 through 200.327 of subpart D or the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable. When requesting proposals for audit services, the objectives and scope of the audit must be made clear, and the non-Federal entity must request a copy of the audit organization's peer review report, which the auditor must provide under GAGAS. Factors to be considered in evaluating each proposal for audit services include the responsiveness to the request for proposal, relevant experience, availability of staff with professional qualifications and technical abilities, the results of peer and external quality control reviews, and price. Whenever possible, the auditee must make efforts to contract with businesses as stated in § 200.321 or the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable.
Auditor procurement.(b)  An auditor who prepares the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan may not be selected to perform the audit required by this part when the indirect costs recovered by the auditee during the prior year exceed $1 million. This restriction applies to the base year used to prepare the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan and any subsequent years in which the resulting indirect cost agreement or cost allocation plan is used to recover costs.
Restriction on auditor preparing indirect cost proposals.(c)  Federal auditors may perform all or part of the work required under this part if they fully comply with the requirements of this part.




Use of Federal auditors.200.510SECTION1§ 200.510   Financial statements.(a)  The auditee must prepare financial statements that reflect its financial position, results of operations or changes in net assets, and, where appropriate, cash flows for the fiscal year audited. The financial statements must be for the same organizational unit and fiscal year chosen to meet this part's requirements. However, organization-wide financial statements of the non-Federal entity may also include departments, agencies, and other organizational units that have separate audits in accordance with § 200.514(a) and prepare separate financial statements.
Financial statements.(b)  The auditee must also prepare a schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for the period covered by the auditee's financial statements. The schedule must include the total Federal awards expended as determined in accordance with § 200.502. The auditee may choose to provide information requested by Federal agencies or pass-through entities to make the schedule easier to use. For example, when a Federal program has multiple Federal award years, the auditee may separately list the amount of Federal awards expended for each year of a Federal award. The schedule must:
Schedule of expenditures of Federal awards.(1) List individual Federal programs by Federal agency using the applicable Assistance Listing number(s). For a cluster of programs, the non-Federal entity must provide the cluster name, a list of individual Federal programs within the cluster, and provide the Federal agency name and the applicable Assistance Listing number(s). For research and development, total Federal awards expended must be shown either by individual Federal award or by Federal agency and major subdivision within the Federal agency. For example, the National Institutes of Health is a major subdivision within the Department of Health and Human Services.
(2) For Federal awards received as a subrecipient, the name of the pass-through entity and identifying number assigned by the pass-through entity must be included.
(3) Provide total Federal awards expended for each individual Federal program and the Assistance Listings number or other identifying number when the Assistance Listings information is unavailable. For a cluster of programs, the auditee must also provide the total for the cluster.
(4) Include the total amount provided to subrecipients from each Federal program.
(5) For loan or loan guarantee programs described in § 200.502(b), identify in the notes to the schedule the balances outstanding at the end of the audit period. This requirement is in addition to including the total Federal awards expended for loan or loan guarantee programs in the schedule.
(6) Include notes describing the significant accounting policies used in preparing the schedule and whether the auditee elected to use the de minimis indirect cost rate of up to 15 percent (see § 200.414).


200.511SECTION1§ 200.511   Audit findings follow-up.(a)  The auditee is responsible for follow-up and corrective action on all audit findings. As part of this responsibility, the auditee must prepare a summary schedule of prior audit findings. The auditee must also prepare a corrective action plan for current year audit findings. The summary schedule of prior audit findings and the corrective action plan must include the reference numbers the auditor assigns to audit findings under § 200.516(c). Since the summary schedule may include audit findings from multiple years, it must include the fiscal year in which the finding initially occurred. The corrective action plan and summary schedule of prior audit findings must include financial statement findings that the auditor was required to report in accordance with GAGAS.
General.(b)  The summary schedule of prior audit findings must report the status of all audit findings included in the prior audit's schedule of findings and questioned costs. The summary schedule must also include audit findings reported in the prior audit's summary schedule of prior audit findings except audit findings listed as corrected in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section or no longer valid or not warranting further action in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
Summary schedule of prior audit findings.(1) When audit findings were fully corrected, the summary schedule need only list the audit findings and state that corrective action was taken.
(2) When audit findings were not corrected or only partially corrected, the summary schedule must describe the reasons for the finding's recurrence, planned corrective action, and any partial corrective action taken. When the corrective action taken significantly differs from the corrective action previously reported in a corrective action plan or the Federal agency's or pass-through entity's management decision, the summary schedule must provide an explanation.
(3) When the auditee believes the audit findings are no longer valid or do not warrant further action, the reasons for this position must be described in the summary schedule. A valid reason for considering an audit finding as not warranting further action is that all of the following have occurred:
(i) Two years have passed since the audit report in which the finding occurred was submitted to the FAC;
(ii) The Federal agency or pass-through entity is not currently following up with the auditee on the audit finding; and
(iii) A management decision was not issued.
(c)  At the completion of the audit, the auditee must prepare a corrective action plan to address each audit finding included in the auditor's report for the current year. The corrective action plan must be a document separate from the auditor's findings described in § 200.516. The corrective action plan must also provide the name(s) of the contact person(s) responsible for the corrective action, the corrective action to be taken, and the anticipated completion date. When the auditee does not agree with the audit findings or believes corrective action is not required, the corrective action plan must include a detailed explanation of the reasons.




Corrective action plan.200.512SECTION1§ 200.512   Report submission.(a)  (1) The audit, the data collection form, and the reporting package must be submitted within 30 calendar days after the auditee receives the auditor's report(s) or nine months after the end of the audit period (whichever is earlier). The cognizant agency for audit or oversight agency for audit (in the absence of a cognizant agency for audit) may authorize an extension when the nine-month timeframe would place an undue burden on the auditee. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the reporting package is due the next business day.
General.(2) The auditee must make copies available for public inspection unless restricted by Federal statute or regulation. Auditees and auditors must ensure that their respective parts of the reporting package do not include protected personally identifiable information.
(b)  The FAC is the repository of record for subpart F reporting packages and the data collection form. All Federal agencies, pass-through entities and others interested in a reporting package and data collection form must obtain it by accessing the FAC.
Data collection.(1) The auditee must submit the required data collection form described in Appendix X of this part. This form provides information about the auditee, its Federal programs, the results of the audit, and whether the audit was completed in accordance with this part. The form must include all information required by this part that is necessary for Federal agencies to use the audit to ensure the integrity of Federal programs. The form includes data elements and a format that OMB must approve, is available from the FAC, and include collections of information from the reporting package described in paragraph (c).
(2) A senior-level representative of the auditee (for example, a State controller, director of finance, chief executive officer, or chief financial officer) must sign a statement to be included as part of the data collection form stating that the auditee complied with the requirements of this part, including that:
(i) The data collection form was prepared in accordance with this part (and the instructions accompanying the form);
(ii) The reporting package does not include protected personally identifiable information;
(iii) The information included in its entirety is accurate and complete; and
(iv) The FAC is authorized to make the reporting package and the form publicly available on a website.
(3) An auditee that is an Indian Tribe or a tribal organization (as defined in the Indian Self-Determination, Education and Assistance Act (ISDEAA), 25 U.S.C. 450b(l)) may opt not to authorize the FAC to make the reporting package publicly available on a website. To opt-out, an Indian Tribe or tribal organization must exclude the authorization described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section. In these instances, the Indian Tribe is responsible for submitting the reporting package directly to any pass-through entities through which it has received a Federal award and to pass-through entities for which the summary schedule of prior audit findings reported the status of any findings related to those Federal awards that the pass-through entity provided. Unless restricted by Federal statute or regulation, if the Indian Tribe opts not to authorize publication, it must make copies of the reporting package available for public inspection.
(4) The auditor must complete the applicable data elements of the data collection form using the information included in the reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section. The auditor must sign a statement to be included as part of the data collection form stating:
(i) The source of information included in the data collection form;
(ii) The auditor's responsibility for the information;
(iii) The data collection form is not a substitute for the reporting package described in paragraph (c); and
(iv) The content of the form is limited to the collection of information prescribed by OMB.
(c)  The reporting package must include the following:
Reporting package.(1) Financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards discussed in § 200.510(a) and (b), respectively;
(2) Summary schedule of prior audit findings discussed in § 200.511(b);
(3) Auditor's report(s) discussed in § 200.515; and
(4) Corrective action plan discussed in § 200.511(c).
(d)  The auditee must electronically submit the data collection form described in paragraph (b) of this section and the reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section to the FAC.
Submission to FAC.(e)  Auditees must submit, when requested by a Federal agency or pass-through entity, a copy of any management letters issued by the auditor.
Requests for management letters issued by the auditor.(f)  Auditees must keep a copy of the data collection form described in paragraph (b) of this section and a copy of the reporting package described in paragraph (c) on file for three years from the date of submission to the FAC. Copies of audit records must be maintained in accordance with § 200.336.
Report retention requirements.(g)  The FAC must make available the reporting packages received in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section and § 200.507(c) to the public, except for Indian Tribes exercising the option in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and maintain a database of completed audits, provide appropriate information to Federal agencies, and follow up with known auditees that have not submitted the required data collection forms and reporting packages.
FAC responsibilities.(h)  Nothing in this part must preclude electronic submissions to the FAC in such a manner as may be approved by OMB.


Electronic filing.ECFRed80de82be1f4a3SUBJGRPFederal Agencies200.513SECTION1§ 200.513   Responsibilities.(a)  (1) A non-Federal entity expending more than $50 million a year in Federal awards must have a cognizant agency for audit. The cognizant agency for audit must be the Federal agency that provides the largest amount of direct funding (as listed on the non-Federal entity's Schedule of expenditures of Federal awards, see § 200.510(b)) unless OMB designates a specific cognizant agency for audit. When the direct funding represents less than 25 percent of the total expenditures (as direct and subawards) by the non-Federal entity, then the Federal agency with the predominant amount of total funding is the designated cognizant agency for audit.
Cognizant agency for audit responsibilities.(2) To provide for continuity of cognizance, the determination of the predominant amount of direct funding must be based upon direct Federal awards expended in the non-Federal entity's fiscal years ending in 2019 and every fifth year after that.
(3) Notwithstanding how audit cognizance is determined, a Federal agency may reassign cognizance to another Federal agency that provides substantial funding to an auditee if it agrees to be the cognizant agency for audit. Within 30 calendar days after any reassignment, both the old and the new cognizant agency for audit must notify the FAC, the auditee, and the auditor (if known) of the change.
(4) The cognizant agency for audit must:
(i) Provide technical audit advice and liaison assistance to auditees and auditors.
(ii) Obtain or conduct quality control reviews on selected audits made by non-Federal auditors and provide the results to other interested organizations.
(iii) Cooperate and support the Federal agency designated by OMB to lead a government-wide analysis to assess the quality of single audits. The government-wide analysis may rely on the current and ongoing quality control review work performed by Federal agencies, State auditors, and professional audit associations. This government-wide audit analysis must be performed at an interval determined by OMB, and the results must be posted publicly. In providing support to the government-wide analysis, a Federal agency must provide the following:
(A) An assessment of the extent to which single audits conform to the requirements, standards, and procedures of this part; and
(B) Recommendations to address audit quality issues, including recommendations for any changes to this part's requirements, standards, and procedures.
(iv) Promptly inform the appropriate Federal law enforcement officials and impacted Federal agencies of any direct reporting by the auditee or its auditor required by GAGAS, Federal statute, or regulation.
(v) Advise the community of independent auditors of any noteworthy or important factual trends related to the quality of audits stemming from quality control reviews. Significant problems or quality issues consistently identified through quality control reviews of audit reports must be referred to appropriate State licensing agencies and professional bodies.
(vi) Advise the auditor, Federal awarding agencies, and, where appropriate, the auditee of any deficiencies found in the audits when the deficiencies require corrective action by the auditor. When advised of deficiencies, the auditee must work with the auditor to take corrective action. If corrective action is not taken, the cognizant agency for audit must notify the auditor, the auditee, and applicable Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities of the facts and make recommendations for follow-up action. Major inadequacies or repetitive substandard performance by auditors must be referred to appropriate State licensing agencies and professional bodies for disciplinary action.
(vii) Coordinate, to the extent practical, audits or reviews made by or for Federal agencies that are in addition to the audits made pursuant to this part, so that the additional audits or reviews build upon, rather than duplicate, audits performed in accordance with this part.
(viii) Coordinate a management decision for cross-cutting audit findings that affect the Federal programs of more than one agency when requested by any Federal agency whose awards are included in the audit finding of the auditee. Cross-cutting audit finding means an audit finding where the same underlying condition or issue affects all Federal awards (including Federal awards of more than one Federal agency or pass-through entity); for example, a cross-cutting audit finding may include an issue related to the recipient's accounting system.
(ix) Coordinate the audit work and reporting responsibilities among auditors to achieve the most cost-effective audit.
(x) Provide advice to auditees as to how to handle changes in fiscal year.
(b)  An auditee who does not have a designated cognizant agency for audit will be under the general oversight of the Federal agency determined in accordance with § 200.1  A Federal agency with oversight for an auditee may reassign oversight to another Federal agency that agrees to be the oversight agency for audit. Within 30 calendar days after any reassignment, both the old and the new oversight agency for audit must provide notice of the change to the FAC, the auditee, and, if known, the auditor. The oversight agency for audit:
Oversight agency for audit responsibilities.oversight agency for audit.(1) Must provide technical advice and assistance to auditees and auditors.
(2) May assume all or some of the responsibilities normally performed by a cognizant agency for audit.
(c)  In addition to all other requirements of this part, the awarding Federal agency must:
Awarding Federal agency responsibilities.(1) Ensure that audits are completed, and reports are received in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements of this part.
(2) Provide technical advice and assistance to auditees and auditors.
(3) Follow-up on audit findings to ensure that non-Federal entities take appropriate and timely corrective action. Follow-up includes:
(i) Issuing a management decision in accordance with § 200.521;
(ii) Monitoring the non-Federal entity's progress implementing a corrective action;
(iii) Using a cooperative audit resolution approach to improve Federal program outcomes through better audit resolution, follow-up, and corrective action, which means the use of audit follow-up techniques promoting prompt corrective action by improving communication, fostering collaboration, promoting trust, and developing an understanding between the Federal agency and the non-Federal entity. This approach is based upon:
(A) A strong commitment by Federal agency and non-Federal entity leadership to Federal program integrity;
(B) Federal agencies strengthening partnerships and working cooperatively with non-Federal entities and their auditors; non-Federal entities and their auditors working cooperatively with Federal agencies;
(C) A focus on current conditions and corrective action going forward;
(D) Federal agencies offering appropriate relief for past noncompliance when audits show prompt corrective action has occurred; and
(E) Federal agency leadership sending a clear message that continued failure to correct conditions identified by audits likely to cause improper payments, fraud, waste, or abuse is unacceptable and will result in sanctions.
(iv) Tracking the effectiveness of the Federal agency's follow-up processes, the effectiveness of single audits in improving non-Federal entity accountability, and the use of single audits in making Federal award decisions. The Federal agency should develop a baseline, metrics, and targets to track, over time, the effectiveness of the Federal agency's process to follow up on audit findings.
(4) Provide OMB with annual updates to the compliance supplement. These updates include working with OMB to ensure that the compliance supplement focuses the auditor on testing the compliance requirements most likely to cause improper payments, fraud, waste, abuse, or generate audit findings for which the Federal agency will take action in accordance with § 200.505. Prior to submitting compliance supplement drafts to OMB, Federal agencies should engage with external audit stakeholders, the Federal agency's Office of Inspector General, and the National Single Audit Coordinator (NSAC).
(5) Provide OMB with the name of a single audit accountable official from among the senior policy officials of the Federal agency. The accountable official must be:
(i) Responsible for ensuring that the Federal agency fulfills the requirements of this section and effectively uses the single audit process to reduce improper payments and improve Federal program outcomes.
(ii) Accountable for improving the effectiveness of the Federal agency's single audit processes in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(iv).
(iii) Responsible for designating the Federal agency's key management single audit liaison.
(6) Provide OMB with the name of a key management single audit liaison. The liaison must:
(i) Serve as the Federal agency's point of contact for the single audit process within and outside the Federal Government.
(ii) Promote interagency coordination, consistency, and information sharing. This includes coordinating audit follow-up, identifying higher risk non-Federal entities, providing input on single audit and follow-up policy, enhancing the utility of the FAC, and identifying ways to use single audit results to improve Federal award accountability and best practices.
(iii) Oversee training for the Federal agency's program management personnel related to the single audit process.
(iv) Promote the Federal agency's use of a cooperative audit resolution approach as described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section.
(v) Coordinate the Federal agency's audit follow-up processes and ensure non-Federal entities implement corrective actions for audit findings.
(vi) Ensure the Federal agency fulfills its responsibility, as a cognizant agency for audit, to coordinate a management decision for cross-cutting audit findings under (a)(4)(viii) of this section. Cross-cutting audit findings means an audit finding where the same underlying condition or issue affects all Federal awards (including Federal awards of more than one Federal agency or pass-through entity). For example, this may include an issue related to the recipient's accounting system.
(vii) Ensure the Federal agency provides OMB with annual updates to the compliance supplement consistent with the compliance supplement preparation guide.
(viii) Support the mission of the Federal agency's single audit accountable official and coordinate with the Federal agency's Office of Inspector General and National Single Audit Coordinator (NSAC).


ECFRea73e47c9a286e6SUBJGRPAuditors200.514SECTION1§ 200.514   Standards and scope of audit.(a)  The audit must be conducted in accordance with GAGAS. The audit must also cover the entire operations of the auditee, or, at the option of the auditee, such audit must include a series of audits that cover departments, agencies, and other organizational units that expended or otherwise administered Federal awards during the audit period. In these instances, the audit must include the financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for each such department, agency, and other organizational unit, which must be considered to be a non-Federal entity. The financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards must be for the same audit period.
General.(b)  The auditor must determine whether the auditee's financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (or a special purpose framework such as cash, modified cash, or regulatory as required by State law). The auditor must also determine whether the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards is stated fairly in all material respects in relation to the auditee's financial statements as a whole.
Financial statements.(c)  (1) The compliance supplement provides guidance on internal controls over Federal programs based upon the guidance in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government issued by the Comptroller General of the United States and the Internal Control-Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
Internal control.(2) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor must perform procedures to obtain an understanding of internal control over Federal programs sufficient to plan the audit to support a low assessed level of control risk of noncompliance for major programs.
(3) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the auditor must:
(i) Plan the testing of internal control over compliance for major programs to support a low assessed level of control risk for assertions relevant to the compliance requirements for each major program; and
(ii) Perform testing of internal control as planned in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.
(4) When internal control over some or all of the compliance requirements for a major program are likely to be ineffective in preventing or detecting noncompliance, the planning and performing of testing described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section are not required for those compliance requirements. However, the auditor must report a significant deficiency or material weakness in accordance with § 200.516, assess the related control risk at the maximum, and consider whether additional compliance tests are required because of ineffective internal control.
(d)  (1) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor must determine whether the auditee has complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards that may have a direct and material effect on each of its major programs.
Compliance.(2) The principal compliance requirements applicable to most Federal programs and the compliance requirements of the largest Federal programs are included in the compliance supplement.
(3) For the compliance requirements related to Federal programs contained in the compliance supplement, an audit of these compliance requirements will meet the requirements of this part. Where there have been changes to the compliance requirements, and the changes are not reflected in the compliance supplement, the auditor must determine the current compliance requirements and modify the audit procedures accordingly. For those Federal programs not covered in the compliance supplement, the auditor must follow the compliance supplement's guidance for programs not included.
(4) The compliance testing must include tests of transactions or other auditing procedures necessary to provide the auditor with sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support an opinion on compliance.
(e)  The auditor must follow up on prior audit findings regardless of whether a prior audit finding is related to a major program in the current year. Audit follow-up includes performing procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with the requirements of § 200.511. When the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding, the auditor must report this condition as a current-year audit finding.
Audit follow-up.(f)  As required in § 200.512(b)(4), the auditor must complete and sign specified sections of the data collection form.




Data collection form.200.515SECTION1§ 200.515   Audit reporting.The auditor's report(s) may be in the form of either combined or separate reports. It may be organized differently from the manner presented in this section. The auditor's report(s) must state that the audit was conducted in accordance with this part and include the following:
(a) An opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) on whether the financial statement(s) of the auditee is presented fairly in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (or a special purpose framework such as cash, modified cash, or regulatory as required by State law). The auditor must also decide whether the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards is stated fairly in all material respects in relation to the auditee's financial statements as a whole.
(b) A report on internal control over financial reporting and compliance with provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and award agreements, noncompliance with which could have a material effect on the financial statements. This report must describe the scope of internal control and compliance testing and the results of the tests. Where applicable, the report must refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section.
(c) A report on compliance for each major program and a report on internal control over compliance. This report must describe the scope of testing of internal control over compliance and include an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the auditee complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards that could have a direct and material effect on each major program and refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section.
(d) A schedule of findings and questioned costs which must include the following three components:
(1) A summary of the auditor's results, which must include:
(i) The type of report the auditor issued (unmodified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, or disclaimer of opinion) on whether the audited financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP;
(ii) A statement about whether significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control were disclosed by the audit of the financial statements;
(iii) A statement as to whether the audit disclosed any noncompliance that is material to the financial statements of the auditee;
(iv) A statement about whether significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control over major programs were disclosed by the audit;
(v) The type of report the auditor issued (unmodified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, or disclaimer of opinion) on compliance for major programs;
(vi) A statement as to whether the audit disclosed any audit findings that the auditor is required to report under § 200.516(a);
(vii) An identification of major programs by listing each individual major program; however, in the case of a cluster of programs, only the cluster name as shown on the schedule of expenditures of Federal Awards is required; (viii) The dollar threshold used to distinguish between Type A and Type B programs, as described in § 200.518(b)(1) or (3) when a recalculation of the Type A threshold is required for large loan or loan guarantees; and
(ix) A statement as to whether the auditee qualified as a low-risk auditee under§ 200.520.
(2) Findings relating to the financial statements required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.
(3) Findings and questioned costs for Federal awards which must include audit findings as defined in § 200.516(a) and be reported in the following manner:
(i) Audit findings (for example, internal control findings, compliance findings, questioned costs, or fraud) that relate to the same issue must be presented as a single audit finding. Where practical, audit findings should be organized by Federal agency or pass-through entity.
(ii) Audit findings that relate to both the financial statements (paragraph (d)(2) of this section) and Federal awards (this paragraph (d)(3)) must be reported in both sections of the schedule. However, the reporting in one section of the schedule may be in summary form and reference a detailed reporting in the other section.
(e) Nothing in this part precludes combining the reporting required by this section with the reporting required by § 200.512(b) when allowed by GAGAS and Appendix X of this part.




200.516SECTION1§ 200.516   Audit findings.(a)  The auditor must report the following as an audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs:
Audit findings reported.(1) Significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over major programs. The auditor's determination of whether a deficiency in internal control is a significant deficiency or a material weakness for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program identified in the compliance supplement.
(2) Material noncompliance with the provisions of Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of Federal awards related to a major program. The auditor's determination of whether noncompliance with the provisions of Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of Federal awards is material for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program identified in the compliance supplement.
(3) Known questioned costs when either known or likely questioned costs are greater than $25,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program. When reporting questioned costs, the auditor must include information to provide proper perspective for evaluating the prevalence and consequences of the questioned costs.
(4) Known questioned costs greater than $25,000 for a Federal program that is not audited as a major program. Except for audit follow-up, the auditor is not required to perform audit procedures for such a Federal program; therefore, the auditor will normally not find questioned costs for a program that is not audited as a major program. However, if the auditor does become aware of questioned costs for a Federal program that is not audited as a major program (for example, as part of audit follow-up or other audit procedures) and the known questioned costs are greater than $25,000, the auditor must report this as an audit finding.
(5) The circumstances concerning why the auditor's report on compliance for each major program is other than an unmodified opinion. This must be included unless the circumstances are otherwise reported as audit findings in the schedule of findings and questioned costs.
(6) Known or likely fraud affecting a Federal award, unless the fraud is otherwise reported as an audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs. This paragraph does not require the auditor to publicly report information that could compromise investigative or legal proceedings or to make an additional reporting when the auditor confirms that the fraud was reported outside the auditor's reports under the direct reporting requirements of GAGAS.
(7) Instances where the results of audit follow-up procedures disclosed that the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with § 200.511(b) materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding.
(b)  Audit findings must be presented with sufficient detail and clarity for the auditee to prepare a corrective action plan and take corrective action and for Federal agencies or pass-through entities to arrive at a management decision. As applicable, the following information must be included in audit findings:
Audit finding detail and clarity.(1) The Federal program and specific Federal award identification, including the Assistance Listings title and number, Federal award identification number and year, the name of the Federal agency, and name of the applicable pass-through entity. When information, such as the Assistance Listings title and number or Federal award identification number, is unavailable, the auditor must provide the best information available to describe the Federal award.
(2) The criteria or specific requirement for the audit finding (for example, the specific Federal statute, regulation, or term and condition of the Federal award). The criteria or specific requirement provides a context for evaluating evidence and understanding findings. The criteria should generally identify the required or desired state or expectation with respect to the program or operation.
(3) The condition found, including facts that support the deficiency identified in the audit finding.
(4) A statement of cause that identifies the reason or explanation for the condition or the factors responsible for the difference between the situation that exists (condition) and the required or desired state (criteria), which may also serve as a basis for recommendations for corrective action
(5) The possible asserted effect to provide sufficient information to the auditee and Federal agency or pass-through entity to permit them to determine the cause and effect to facilitate prompt and proper corrective action. A statement of the effect or potential effect should provide a clear, logical link to establish the impact or potential impact of the difference between the condition and the criteria.
(6) The identification of known questioned costs, by applicable Assistance Listing number(s) and Federal award identification number(s), and how these questioned costs were computed.
(7) When there are known questioned costs but the dollar amount is undetermined or not reported, a description of why the dollar amount was undetermined or otherwise could not be reported.
(8) Information to provide proper perspective for evaluating the prevalence and consequences of the audit finding. For example, whether the audit finding represents an isolated instance or a systemic problem. Where appropriate, instances identified must be related to the universe and the number of cases examined and be quantified in terms of dollar value. In addition, the audit finding should indicate whether the sampling was a statistically valid sample.
(9) The identification of whether the audit finding is a repeat of a finding in the immediately prior audit. The audit finding must identify the applicable prior year audit finding reference numbers in these instances.
(10) Recommendations to prevent future occurrences of the deficiency identified in the audit finding.
(11) Views of responsible officials of the auditee.
(c)  Each audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs must include a reference number in the format meeting the requirements of the data collection form submission (see § 200.512(b)).




Reference numbers.200.517SECTION1§ 200.517   Audit documentation.(a)  The auditor must retain audit documentation and reports for a minimum of three years after the date of issuance of the auditor's report(s) to the auditee. The cognizant agency for audit, oversight agency for audit, cognizant agency for indirect costs, or pass-through entity may extend the retention period by providing written notification to the auditor. When the auditor is aware that the Federal agency, pass-through entity, or auditee is contesting an audit finding, the auditor must contact the parties contesting the audit finding for guidance prior to the destruction of the audit documentation and reports.
Retention of audit documentation.(b)  Audit documentation must be made available upon request to the cognizant or oversight agency for audit or its designee, cognizant agency for indirect cost, a Federal agency, or GAO at the completion of the audit, as part of a quality review, to resolve audit findings, or to carry out oversight responsibilities consistent with the purposes of this part. Access to audit documentation includes the right of Federal agencies to obtain copies of audit documentation as is reasonable and necessary.




Access to audit documentation.200.518SECTION1§ 200.518   Major program determination.(a)  The auditor must use a risk-based approach to determine which Federal programs are major programs. This risk-based approach must consider current and prior audit experience, oversight by Federal agencies and pass-through entities, and the inherent risk of the Federal program. The process described in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section must be followed.
General.(b)  (1) The auditor must identify and label the larger Federal programs as Type A programs. Type A programs are defined as Federal programs with Federal awards expended during the audit period exceeding the levels outlined in table 1:
Step one.(2) Federal programs not labeled Type A under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be labeled Type B programs.
(3) Including large loans and loan guarantees (loans) must not result in the exclusion of other programs as Type A programs. A Federal program providing loans is considered a large loan program when it exceeds four times the largest non-loan program. The auditor must identify each large loan program as a Type A program and exclude its values in determining other Type A programs. This recalculation of the Type A program is performed after removing the total of all large loan programs. For this paragraph, a program is only considered a Federal program providing loans if the value of Federal awards expended for loans within the program comprises 50 percent or more of the total Federal awards expended for the program. A cluster of programs is treated as one program, and the value of Federal awards expended under a loan program is determined as described in § 200.502.
(4) For biennial audits (see § 200.504), the determination of Type A and Type B programs must be based on the Federal awards expended during the two-year audit period.
(c)  (1) The auditor must identify Type A programs that are low-risk. In making this determination, the auditor must consider whether the requirements in § 200.519(c), the results of audit follow-up, or any changes in personnel or systems affecting the program indicate significantly increased risk and preclude the program from being low-risk. For a Type A program to be considered low-risk, it must have been audited as a major program in at least one of the two most recent audit periods (in the most recent audit period in the case of a biennial audit), and, in the most recent audit period, the program must not have had:
Step two.(i) Internal control deficiencies that were identified as material weaknesses in the auditor's report on internal control for major programs as required under § 200.515(c);
(ii) A modified opinion on the program in the auditor's report on major programs as required under § 200.515(c); or
(iii) Known or likely questioned costs that exceed five percent of the total Federal awards expended for the program.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, OMB may approve a Federal agency request that a Type A program not be considered low-risk for a specific recipient. For example, it may be necessary for a large Type A program to be audited as a major program each year for a particular recipient for the Federal agency to comply with 31 U.S.C. 3515. The Federal agency must notify the auditee and, if known, the auditor of OMB's approval at least 180 calendar days prior to the end of the fiscal year to be audited.
(d)  (1) The auditor must identify high-risk Type B programs using professional judgment and the criteria in § 200.519. However, the auditor is not required to identify more high-risk Type B programs than at least one-fourth of the number of low-risk Type A programs identified as low-risk under step two. Except for known material weakness in internal control or compliance problems as discussed in § 200.519(b)(1), (2), and (c)(1), a single criterion in risk would rarely cause a Type B program to be considered high-risk. When identifying which Type B programs to assess for risk, the auditor is encouraged to use an approach that provides an opportunity for different high-risk Type B programs to be audited as major programs over a period of time.
Step three.(2) The auditor is not expected to perform risk assessments on relatively small Federal programs. Therefore, the auditor is only required to perform risk assessments on Type B programs that exceed 25 percent (0.25) of the Type A threshold determined in step one.
(e)  At a minimum, the auditor must audit all of the following as major programs:
Step four.(1) All Type A programs not identified as low-risk under step two.
(2) All Type B programs identified as high-risk under step three.
(3) Additional programs as necessary to comply with the percentage of coverage rule described in paragraph (f). This rule may require the auditor to audit more programs as major programs than the number of Type A programs.
(f)  When the auditee meets the criteria in § 200.520, the auditor only needs to audit the major programs identified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section and such additional Federal programs with Federal awards expended that, in the aggregate, all major programs encompass at least 20 percent (0.20) of total Federal awards expended. Otherwise, the auditor must audit the major programs identified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section and such additional Federal programs with Federal awards expended that, in the aggregate, all major programs encompass at least 40 percent (0.40) of total Federal awards expended.
Percentage of coverage rule.(g)  The auditor must include in the audit documentation the risk analysis used for determining major programs.
Documentation of risk.(h)  The auditor's judgment in applying the risk-based approach to determine major programs must be presumed correct when the determination was performed and documented in accordance with this part. Challenges by a Federal agency or pass-through entity must only be for clearly improper use of the requirements in this part. However, a Federal agency or pass-through entity may provide auditors guidance about the risk of a particular Federal program. The auditor must consider this guidance in determining major programs in audits not yet completed.

The auditor must consider criteria, such as those described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, to identify risk in Federal programs. Also, as part of the risk analysis, the auditor may wish to discuss a particular Federal program with auditee management and the Federal agency or pass-through entity.
General.(b)  (1) Weaknesses in internal control over Federal programs would indicate higher risk. Therefore, consideration should be given to the control environment over Federal programs. This includes considering factors such as the expectation of management's adherence to Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards, and the competence and experience of personnel who administer the Federal programs.
Current and prior audit experience.(i) A Federal program administered under multiple internal control structures may have higher risk. When assessing risk in a large single audit, the auditor must consider whether weaknesses are isolated in a single operating unit (for example, one college campus) or pervasive throughout the entity.
(ii) A weak system for monitoring subrecipients would indicate higher risk when significant parts of a Federal program are passed to subrecipients through subawards.
(2) Prior audit findings would indicate higher risk, especially when the situations identified in the audit findings could significantly impact a Federal program or have not been corrected.
(3) Federal programs not recently audited as major programs may be of higher risk than those recently audited as major programs without audit findings.
(c)  (1) The oversight exercised by Federal agencies or pass-through entities may be used to assess risk. For example, recent monitoring or other reviews performed by an oversight entity that disclosed no significant problems would indicate lower risk, whereas monitoring that disclosed significant problems would indicate higher risk.
Oversight exercised by Federal agencies and pass-through entities.(2) With the concurrence of OMB, a Federal agency may identify Federal programs that are higher risk. OMB will identify these Federal programs in the compliance supplement.
(d)  (1) The nature of a Federal program may indicate risk. Consideration should be given to the complexity of the program and the extent to which the Federal program contracts for goods and services. For example, Federal programs that disburse funds through third-party contracts or have eligibility criteria may be higher risk. Federal programs primarily involving staff payroll costs may be at high risk for noncompliance with the requirements of § 200.430 but otherwise be at low risk.
Inherent risk of the Federal program.(2) The phase of a Federal program in its lifecycle at the Federal agency may indicate risk. For example, a new Federal program with new or interim regulations may have higher risk than an established program with time-tested regulations. Also, significant changes in Federal programs, statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of Federal awards may increase risk.
(3) The phase of a Federal program in its lifecycle at the auditee may indicate risk. For example, during the first and last years that an auditee participates in a Federal program, the risk may be higher due to the start-up or closeout of program activities and staff.
(4) Type B programs with larger Federal awards expended would be of higher risk than programs with substantially smaller Federal awards expended.




200.520SECTION1§ 200.520   Criteria for a low-risk auditee.An auditee that meets all of the following conditions for each of the preceding two audit periods must qualify as a low-risk auditee and be eligible for reduced audit coverage in accordance with § 200.518.
(a) Single audits were performed on an annual basis in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, including submitting the data collection form and the reporting package to the FAC within the timeframe specified in § 200.512. A non-Federal entity that has biennial audits does not qualify as a low-risk auditee.
(b) The auditor's opinion on whether the financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (or a special purpose framework such as cash, modified cash, or regulatory as required by State law), and the auditor's in-relation-to opinion on the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards were unmodified.
(c) No internal control deficiencies were identified as material weaknesses under the requirements of GAGAS.
(d) The auditor did not report a substantial doubt about the auditee's ability to continue as a going concern.
(e) None of the Federal programs had audit findings from any of the following in either of the preceding two audit periods in which they were classified as Type A programs:
(1) Internal control deficiencies that were identified as material weaknesses in the auditor's report on internal control for major programs as required under § 200.515(c);
(2) A modified opinion on a major program in the auditor's report on major programs as required under § 200.515(c); or
(3) Known or likely questioned costs that exceeded five percent (.05) of the total Federal awards expended for a Type A program during the audit period.


ECFR4424206eaecf751SUBJGRPManagement Decisions200.521SECTION1§ 200.521   Management decisions.(a)  The management decision must clearly state whether or not the audit finding is sustained, the reasons for the decision, and the expected auditee action to repay disallowed costs, make financial adjustments or take other action. If the auditee has not completed corrective action, a timetable for follow-up should be given. Prior to issuing the management decision, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may request additional information or documentation from the auditee, including a request for auditor assurance related to the documentation, as a way of mitigating disallowed costs. The management decision should describe any appeal process available to the auditee. While not required, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may also issue a management decision on findings relating to the financial statements, which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.
General.(b)  The cognizant agency for audit is responsible for coordinating a management decision for audit findings that affect the programs of more than one Federal agency (see § 200.513(a)(4)(viii)). The awarding Federal agency is responsible for issuing a management decision for audit findings that affect the Federal awards it makes to a non-Federal entity (see § 200.513(c)(3)(i)).
Federal agency.(c)  The pass-through entity is responsible for issuing a management decision for audit findings that affect subawards it issues to subrecipients under a Federal award (see § 200.332(e)).
Pass-through entity.(d)  The Federal agency or pass-through entity responsible for issuing a management decision must do so within six months of the FAC's acceptance of the audit report. The auditee must initiate and proceed with corrective action as rapidly as possible and corrective action should begin no later than upon receipt of the audit report.
Time requirements.(e)  Management decisions must include the reference numbers the auditor assigned to each audit finding in accordance with § 200.516(c).

NAppendix II to Part 200APPENDIX1Appendix II to Part 200—Contract Provisions for Non-Federal Entity Contracts Under Federal Awards
In addition to other provisions required by the Federal agency or non-Federal entity, all contracts made by the non-Federal entity under the Federal award must contain provisions covering the following, as applicable.
(A) Contracts for more than the simplified acquisition threshold, which is the inflation adjusted amount determined by the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (Councils) as authorized by 41 U.S.C. 1908, must address administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such sanctions and penalties as appropriate.
(B) All contracts in excess of $10,000 must address termination for cause and for convenience by the non-Federal entity including the manner by which it will be effected and the basis for settlement.
(C) Equal Employment Opportunity. Except as otherwise provided under 41 CFR Part 60, all contracts that meet the definition of “federally assisted construction contract” in 41 CFR Part 60-1.3 must include the equal opportunity clause provided under 41 CFR 60-1.4(b), in accordance with Executive Order 11246, “Equal Employment Opportunity” (30 FR 12319, 12935, 3 CFR Part, 1964-1965 Comp., p. 339), as amended by Executive Order 11375, “Amending Executive Order 11246 Relating to Equal Employment Opportunity,” and implementing regulations at 41 CFR part 60, “Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Equal Employment Opportunity, Department of Labor.”
(D) Davis-Bacon Act, as amended (40 U.S.C. 3141-3148). When required by Federal program legislation, all prime construction contracts in excess of $2,000 awarded by non-Federal entities must include a provision for compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 3141-3144, and 3146-3148) as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5, “Labor Standards Provisions Applicable to Contracts Covering Federally Financed and Assisted Construction”). In accordance with the statute, contractors must be required to pay wages to laborers and mechanics at a rate not less than the prevailing wages specified in a wage determination made by the Secretary of Labor. In addition, contractors must be required to pay wages not less than once a week. The non-Federal entity must place a copy of the current prevailing wage determination issued by the Department of Labor in each solicitation. The decision to award a contract or subcontract must be conditioned upon the acceptance of the wage determination. The non-Federal entity must report all suspected or reported violations to the Federal awarding agency. The contracts must also include a provision for compliance with the Copeland “Anti-Kickback” Act (40 U.S.C. 3145), as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 3, “Contractors and Subcontractors on Public Building or Public Work Financed in Whole or in Part by Loans or Grants from the United States”). The Act provides that each contractor or subrecipient must be prohibited from inducing, by any means, any person employed in the construction, completion, or repair of public work, to give up any part of the compensation to which he or she is otherwise entitled. The non-Federal entity must report all suspected or reported violations to the Federal awarding agency.
(E) Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 3701-3708). Where applicable, all contracts awarded by the non-Federal entity in excess of $100,000 that involve the employment of mechanics or laborers must include a provision for compliance with 40 U.S.C. 3702 and 3704, as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR Part 5). Under 40 U.S.C. 3702 of the Act, each contractor must be required to compute the wages of every mechanic and laborer on the basis of a standard work week of 40 hours. Work in excess of the standard work week is permissible provided that the worker is compensated at a rate of not less than one and a half times the basic rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in the work week. The requirements of 40 U.S.C. 3704 are applicable to construction work and provide that no laborer or mechanic must be required to work in surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous. These requirements do not apply to the purchases of supplies or materials or articles ordinarily available on the open market, or contracts for transportation or transmission of intelligence.
(F) Rights to Inventions Made Under a Contract or Agreement. If the Federal award meets the definition of “funding agreement” under 37 CFR § 401.2 (a) and the recipient or subrecipient wishes to enter into a contract with a small business firm or nonprofit organization regarding the substitution of parties, assignment or performance of experimental, developmental, or research work under that “funding agreement,” the recipient or subrecipient must comply with the requirements of 37 CFR Part 401, “Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements,” and any implementing regulations issued by the awarding agency.
(G) Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q.) and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251-1387), as amended—Contracts and subgrants of amounts in excess of $150,000 must contain a provision that requires the non-Federal award to agree to comply with all applicable standards, orders or regulations issued pursuant to the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q) and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251-1387). Violations must be reported to the Federal awarding agency and the Regional Office of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
(H) Debarment and Suspension (Executive Orders 12549 and 12689)—A contract award (see 2 CFR 180.220) must not be made to parties listed on the governmentwide exclusions in the System for Award Management (SAM), in accordance with the OMB guidelines at 2 CFR 180 that implement Executive Orders 12549 (3 CFR part 1986 Comp., p. 189) and 12689 (3 CFR part 1989 Comp., p. 235), “Debarment and Suspension.” SAM Exclusions contains the names of parties debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded by agencies, as well as parties declared ineligible under statutory or regulatory authority other than Executive Order 12549.

NAppendix III to Part 200APPENDIX1Appendix III to Part 200—Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs)




A. General
B. Identification and Assignment of Indirect (F&A) Costs
C. Determination and Application of Indirect (F&A) Cost Rate or Rates
D. Simplified Method for Small Institutions
E. Documentation Requirements
F. Certification
This appendix provides criteria for identifying and computing indirect (or indirect (F&A)) rates at IHEs (institutions). Indirect (F&A) costs are those that are incurred for common or joint objectives and therefore cannot be identified readily and specifically with a particular sponsored project, an instructional activity, or any other institutional activity. See subsection B.1 for a discussion of the components of indirect (F&A) costs.


Refers to instruction, organized research, other sponsored activities and other institutional activities as defined in this section:
a.  means the teaching and training activities of an institution. Except for research training as provided in subsection b, this term includes all teaching and training activities, whether they are offered for credits toward a degree or certificate or on a non-credit basis, and whether they are offered through regular academic departments or separate divisions, such as a summer school division or an extension division. Also considered part of this major function are departmental research, and, where agreed to, university research.
Instruction(1)  means specific instructional or training activity established by grant, contract, or cooperative agreement. For purposes of the cost principles, this activity may be considered a major function even though an institution's accounting treatment may include it in the instruction function.
Sponsored instruction and training(2)  means research, development and scholarly activities that are not organized research and, consequently, are not separately budgeted and accounted for. Departmental research, for purposes of this document, is not considered as a major function, but as a part of the instruction function of the institution.
Departmental research(3) Only mandatory cost sharing or cost sharing specifically committed in the project budget must be included in the organized research base for computing the indirect (F&A) cost rate or reflected in any allocation of indirect costs. Salary costs above statutory limits are not considered cost sharing.
b.  means all research and development activities of an institution that are separately budgeted and accounted for. It includes:
Organized research(1)  means all research and development activities that are sponsored by Federal and non-Federal agencies and organizations. This term includes activities involving the training of individuals in research techniques (commonly called research training) where such activities utilize the same facilities as other research and development activities and where such activities are not included in the instruction function.
Sponsored research(2)  means all research and development activities that are separately budgeted and accounted for by the institution under an internal application of institutional funds. University research, for purposes of this document, must be combined with sponsored research under the function of organized research.
University researchc.  means programs and projects financed by Federal and non-Federal agencies and organizations which involve the performance of work other than instruction and organized research. Examples of such programs and projects are health service projects and community service programs. However, when any of these activities are undertaken by the institution without outside support, they may be classified as other institutional activities.
Other sponsored activitiesd.  means all activities of an institution except for instruction, departmental research, organized research, and other sponsored activities, as defined in this section; indirect (F&A) cost activities identified in this Appendix paragraph B, Identification and assignment of indirect (F&A) costs; and specialized services facilities described in § 200.468 of this part.


Other institutional activitiesa.  A base period for distribution of indirect (F&A) costs is the period during which the costs are incurred. The base period normally should coincide with the fiscal year established by the institution, but in any event the base period should be so selected as to avoid inequities in the distribution of costs.
Base period.b.  The overall objective of the indirect (F&A) cost allocation process is to distribute the indirect (F&A) costs described in Section B, Identification and assignment of indirect (F&A) costs, to the major functions of the institution in proportions reasonably consistent with the nature and extent of their use of the institution's resources. In order to achieve this objective, it may be necessary to provide for selective distribution by establishing separate groupings of cost within one or more of the indirect (F&A) cost categories referred to in subsection B.1. In general, the cost groupings established within a category should constitute, in each case, a pool of those items of expense that are considered to be of like nature in terms of their relative contribution to (or degree of remoteness from) the particular cost objectives to which distribution is appropriate. Cost groupings should be established considering the general guides provided in subsection c of this section. Each such pool or cost grouping should then be distributed individually to the related cost objectives, using the distribution base or method most appropriate in light of the guidelines set forth in subsection d of this section.
Need for cost groupings.c.  The extent to which separate cost groupings and selective distribution would be appropriate at an institution is a matter of judgment to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Typical situations which may warrant the establishment of two or more separate cost groupings (based on account classification or analysis) within an indirect (F&A) cost category include but are not limited to the following:
General considerations on cost groupings.(1) If certain items or categories of expense relate solely to one of the major functions of the institution or to less than all functions, such expenses should be set aside as a separate cost grouping for direct assignment or selective allocation in accordance with the guides provided in subsections b and d.
(2) If any types of expense ordinarily treated as general administration or departmental administration are charged to Federal awards as direct costs, expenses applicable to other activities of the institution when incurred for the same purposes in like circumstances must, through separate cost groupings, be excluded from the indirect (F&A) costs allocable to those Federal awards and included in the direct cost of other activities for cost allocation purposes.
(3) If it is determined that certain expenses are for the support of a service unit or facility whose output is susceptible of measurement on a workload or other quantitative basis, such expenses should be set aside as a separate cost grouping for distribution on such basis to organized research, instructional, and other activities at the institution or within the department.
(4) If activities provide their own purchasing, personnel administration, building maintenance or similar service, the distribution of general administration and general expenses, or operation and maintenance expenses to such activities should be accomplished through cost groupings which include only that portion of central indirect (F&A) costs (such as for overall management) which are properly allocable to such activities.
(5) If the institution elects to treat fringe benefits as indirect (F&A) charges, such costs should be set aside as a separate cost grouping for selective distribution to related cost objectives.
(6) The number of separate cost groupings within a category should be held within practical limits, after taking into consideration the materiality of the amounts involved and the degree of precision attainable through less selective methods of distribution.
d. Selection of distribution method.
(1) Actual conditions must be taken into account in selecting the method or base to be used in distributing individual cost groupings. The essential consideration in selecting a base is that it be the one best suited for assigning the pool of costs to cost objectives in accordance with benefits derived; with a traceable cause-and-effect relationship; or with logic and reason, where neither benefit nor a cause-and-effect relationship is determinable.
(2) If a cost grouping can be identified directly with the cost objective benefitted, it should be assigned to that cost objective.
(3) If the expenses in a cost grouping are more general in nature, the distribution may be based on a cost analysis study which results in an equitable distribution of the costs. Such cost analysis studies may take into consideration weighting factors, population, or space occupied if appropriate. Cost analysis studies, however, must (a) be appropriately documented in sufficient detail for subsequent review by the cognizant agency for indirect costs, (b) distribute the costs to the related cost objectives in accordance with the relative benefits derived, (c) be statistically sound, (d) be performed specifically at the institution at which the results are to be used, and (e) be reviewed periodically, but not less frequently than rate negotiations, updated if necessary, and used consistently. Any assumptions made in the study must be stated and explained. The use of cost analysis studies and periodic changes in the method of cost distribution must be fully justified.
(4) If a cost analysis study is not performed, or if the study does not result in an equitable distribution of the costs, the distribution must be made in accordance with the appropriate base cited in Section B, unless one of the following conditions is met:
(a) It can be demonstrated that the use of a different base would result in a more equitable allocation of the costs, or that a more readily available base would not increase the costs charged to Federal awards, or
(b) The institution qualifies for, and elects to use, the simplified method for computing indirect (F&A) cost rates described in Section D.
(5) Notwithstanding subsection (3), effective July 1, 1998, a cost analysis or base other than that in Section B must not be used to distribute utility or student services costs. Instead, subsection B.4.c, may be used in the recovery of utility costs.
e. Order of distribution.
(1) Indirect (F&A) costs are the broad categories of costs discussed in Section B.1.
(2) Depreciation, interest expenses, operation and maintenance expenses, and general administrative and general expenses should be allocated in that order to the remaining indirect (F&A) cost categories as well as to the major functions and specialized service facilities of the institution. Other cost categories may be allocated in the order determined to be most appropriate by the institutions. When cross allocation of costs is made as provided in subsection (3), this order of allocation does not apply.
(3) Normally an indirect (F&A) cost category will be considered closed once it has been allocated to other cost objectives, and costs may not be subsequently allocated to it. However, a cross allocation of costs between two or more indirect (F&A) cost categories may be used if such allocation will result in a more equitable allocation of costs. If a cross allocation is used, an appropriate modification to the composition of the indirect (F&A) cost categories described in Section B is required.


See § 200.414 which provides the basis for these indirect cost requirements.


a. The expenses under this heading are the portion of the costs of the institution's buildings, capital improvements to land and buildings, and equipment which are computed in accordance with § 200.436.
b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses included in this category must be allocated in the following manner:
(1) Depreciation on buildings used exclusively in the conduct of a single function, and on capital improvements and equipment used in such buildings, must be assigned to that function.
(2) Depreciation on buildings used for more than one function, and on capital improvements and equipment used in such buildings, must be allocated to the individual functions performed in each building on the basis of usable square feet of space, excluding common areas such as hallways, stairwells, and rest rooms.
(3) Depreciation on buildings, capital improvements and equipment related to space (e.g., individual rooms, laboratories) used jointly by more than one function (as determined by the users of the space) must be treated as follows. The cost of each jointly used unit of space must be allocated to benefitting functions on the basis of:
(a) The employee full-time equivalents (FTEs) or salaries and wages of those individual functions benefitting from the use of that space; or
(b) Institution-wide employee FTEs or salaries and wages applicable to the benefitting major functions (see Section A.1) of the institution.
(4) Depreciation on certain capital improvements to land, such as paved parking areas, fences, sidewalks, and the like, not included in the cost of buildings, must be allocated to user categories of students and employees on a full-time equivalent basis. The amount allocated to the student category must be assigned to the instruction function of the institution. The amount allocated to the employee category must be further allocated to the major functions of the institution in proportion to the salaries and wages of all employees applicable to those functions.
Interest on debt associated with certain buildings, equipment and capital improvements, as defined in § 200.449, must be classified as an expenditure under the category Facilities. These costs must be allocated in the same manner as the depreciation on the buildings, equipment and capital improvements to which the interest relates.


a. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for the administration, supervision, operation, maintenance, preservation, and protection of the institution's physical plant. They include expenses normally incurred for such items as janitorial and utility services; repairs and ordinary or normal alterations of buildings, furniture and equipment; care of grounds; maintenance and operation of buildings and other plant facilities; security; earthquake and disaster preparedness; environmental safety; hazardous waste disposal; property, liability and all other insurance relating to property; space and capital leasing; facility planning and management; and central receiving. The operation and maintenance expense category should also include its allocable share of fringe benefit costs, depreciation, and interest costs.
b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses included in this category must be allocated in the same manner as described in subsection 2.b for depreciation.
c. A utility cost adjustment of up to 1.3 percentage points may be included in the negotiated indirect cost rate of the IHE for organized research, per the computation alternatives in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section:
(1) Where space is devoted to a single function and metering allows unambiguous measurement of usage related to that space, costs must be assigned to the function located in that space.
(2) Where space is allocated to different functions and metering does not allow unambiguous measurement of usage by function, costs must be allocated as follows:
(i) Utilities costs should be apportioned to functions in the same manner as depreciation, based on the calculated difference between the site or building actual square footage for monitored research laboratory space (site, building, floor, or room), and a separate calculation prepared by the IHE using the “effective square footage” described in subsection (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
(ii) “Effective square footage” allocated to research laboratory space must be calculated as the actual square footage times the relative energy utilization index (REUI) posted on the OMB Web site at the time of a rate determination.
A. This index is the ratio of a laboratory energy use index (lab EUI) to the corresponding index for overall average college or university space (college EUI).
B. In July 2012, values for these two indices (taken respectively from the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory “Labs for the 21st Century” benchmarking tool and the US Department of Energy “Buildings Energy Databook” and were 310 kBtu/sq ft-yr. and 155 kBtu/sq ft-yr., so that the adjustment ratio is 2.0 by this methodology. To retain currency, OMB will adjust the EUI numbers from time to time (no more often than annually nor less often than every 5 years), using reliable and publicly disclosed data. Current values of both the EUIs and the REUI will be posted on the OMB website.


a. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for the general executive and administrative offices of educational institutions and other expenses of a general character which do not relate solely to any major function of the institution;  solely to (1) instruction, (2) organized research, (3) other sponsored activities, or (4) other institutional activities. The general administration and general expense category should also include its allocable share of fringe benefit costs, operation and maintenance expense, depreciation, and interest costs. Examples of general administration and general expenses include: Those expenses incurred by administrative offices that serve the entire university system of which the institution is a part; central offices of the institution such as the President's or Chancellor's office, the offices for institution-wide financial management, business services, budget and planning, personnel management, and safety and risk management; the office of the General Counsel; and the operations of the central administrative management information systems. General administration and general expenses must not include expenses incurred within non-university-wide deans' offices, academic departments, organized research units, or similar organizational units. (See subsection 6.)
i.e.,b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses included in this category must be grouped first according to common major functions of the institution to which they render services or provide benefits. The aggregate expenses of each group must then be allocated to serviced or benefitted functions on the modified total cost basis. Modified total costs consist of the same elements as those in Section C.2. When an activity included in this indirect (F&A) cost category provides a service or product to another institution or organization, an appropriate adjustment must be made to either the expenses or the basis of allocation or both, to assure a proper allocation of costs.
a. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for administrative and supporting services that benefit common or joint departmental activities or objectives in academic deans' offices, academic departments and divisions, and organized research units. Organized research units include such units as institutes, study centers, and research centers. Departmental administration expenses are subject to the following limitations.
(1) Academic deans' offices. Salaries and operating expenses are limited to those attributable to administrative functions.
(2) Academic departments:
(a) Salaries and fringe benefits attributable to the administrative work (including bid and proposal preparation) of faculty (including department heads) and other professional personnel conducting research and/or instruction, must be allowed at a rate of 3.6 percent of modified total direct costs. This category does not include professional business or professional administrative officers. This allowance must be added to the computation of the indirect (F&A) cost rate for major functions in Section C; the expenses covered by the allowance must be excluded from the departmental administration cost pool. No documentation is required to support this allowance.
(b) Other administrative and supporting expenses incurred within academic departments are allowable provided they are treated consistently in like circumstances. This would include expenses such as the salaries of secretarial and clerical staffs, the salaries of administrative officers and assistants, travel, office supplies, stockrooms, and the like.
(3) Other fringe benefit costs applicable to the salaries and wages included in subsections (1) and (2) are allowable, as well as an appropriate share of general administration and general expenses, operation and maintenance expenses, and depreciation.
(4) Federal agencies may authorize reimbursement of additional costs for department heads and faculty only in exceptional cases where an institution can demonstrate undue hardship or detriment to project performance.
b. The following guidelines apply to the determination of departmental administrative costs as direct or indirect (F&A) costs.
(1) In developing the departmental administration cost pool, special care should be exercised to ensure that costs incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances are treated consistently as either direct or indirect (F&A) costs. For example, salaries of technical staff, laboratory supplies ( chemicals), telephone toll charges, animals, animal care costs, computer costs, travel costs, and specialized shop costs must be treated as direct costs wherever identifiable to a particular cost objective. Direct charging of these costs may be accomplished through specific identification of individual costs to benefitting cost objectives, or through recharge centers or specialized service facilities, as appropriate under the circumstances. See §§ 200.413(c) and 200.468.
e.g.,(2) Items such as office supplies, postage, local telephone costs, and memberships must normally be treated as indirect (F&A) costs.
c. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses included in this category must be allocated as follows:
(1) The administrative expenses of the dean's office of each college and school must be allocated to the academic departments within that college or school on the modified total cost basis.
(2) The administrative expenses of each academic department, and the department's share of the expenses allocated in subsection (1) must be allocated to the appropriate functions of the department on the modified total cost basis.
a. The expenses under this heading are limited to those incurred by a separate organization(s) established primarily to administer sponsored projects, including such functions as grant and contract administration (Federal and non-Federal), special security, purchasing, personnel, administration, and editing and publishing of research and other reports. They include the salaries and expenses of the head of such organization, assistants, and immediate staff, together with the salaries and expenses of personnel engaged in supporting activities maintained by the organization, such as stock rooms, print shops, and the like. This category also includes an allocable share of fringe benefit costs, general administration and general expenses, operation and maintenance expenses, and depreciation. Appropriate adjustments will be made for services provided to other functions or organizations.
b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses included in this category must be allocated to the major functions of the institution under which the sponsored projects are conducted on the basis of the modified total cost of sponsored projects.
c. An appropriate adjustment must be made to eliminate any duplicate charges to Federal awards when this category includes similar or identical activities as those included in the general administration and general expense category or other indirect (F&A) cost items, such as accounting, procurement, or personnel administration.
a. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for the operation of the library, including the cost of books and library materials purchased for the library, less any items of library income that qualify as applicable credits under § 200.406. The library expense category should also include the fringe benefits applicable to the salaries and wages included therein, an appropriate share of general administration and general expense, operation and maintenance expense, and depreciation. Costs incurred in the purchases of rare books (museum-type books) with no value to Federal awards should not be allocated to them.
b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses included in this category must be allocated first on the basis of primary categories of users, including students, professional employees, and other users.
(1) The student category must consist of full-time equivalent students enrolled at the institution, regardless of whether they earn credits toward a degree or certificate.
(2) The professional employee category must consist of all faculty members and other professional employees of the institution, on a full-time equivalent basis. This category may also include post-doctorate fellows and graduate students.
(3) The other users category must consist of a reasonable factor as determined by institutional records to account for all other users of library facilities.
c. Amount allocated in paragraph b of this section must be assigned further as follows:
(1) The amount in the student category must be assigned to the instruction function of the institution.
(2) The amount in the professional employee category must be assigned to the major functions of the institution in proportion to the salaries and wages of all faculty members and other professional employees applicable to those functions.
(3) The amount in the other users category must be assigned to the other institutional activities function of the institution.


a. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for the administration of student affairs and for services to students, including expenses of such activities as deans of students, admissions, registrar, counseling and placement services, student advisers, student health and infirmary services, catalogs, and commencements and convocations. The salaries of members of the academic staff whose responsibilities to the institution require administrative work that benefits sponsored projects may also be included to the extent that the portion charged to student administration is determined in accordance with subpart E of this Part. This expense category also includes the fringe benefit costs applicable to the salaries and wages included therein, an appropriate share of general administration and general expenses, operation and maintenance, interest expense, and depreciation.
b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d, the expenses in this category must be allocated to the instruction function, and subsequently to Federal awards in that function.
a. The items to be accumulated under this heading are the reimbursements and other payments from the Federal Government which are made to the institution to support solely, specifically, and directly, in whole or in part, any of the administrative or service activities described in subsections 2 through 9.
b. The items in this group must be treated as a credit to the affected individual indirect (F&A) cost category before that category is allocated to benefitting functions.


a. (1) Subject to subsection b, the separate categories of indirect (F&A) costs allocated to each major function of the institution as prescribed in Section B, must be aggregated and treated as a common pool for that function. The amount in each pool must be divided by the distribution base described in subsection 2 to arrive at a single indirect (F&A) cost rate for each function.
(2) The rate for each function is used to distribute indirect (F&A) costs to individual Federal awards of that function. Since a common pool is established for each major function of the institution, a separate indirect (F&A) cost rate would be established for each of the major functions described in Section A.1 under which Federal awards are carried out.
(3) Each institution's indirect (F&A) cost rate process must be appropriately designed to ensure that Federal sponsors do not in any way subsidize the indirect (F&A) costs of other sponsors, specifically activities sponsored by industry and foreign governments. Accordingly, each allocation method used to identify and allocate the indirect (F&A) cost pools, as described in Sections A.2 and B.2 through B.9, must contain the full amount of the institution's modified total costs or other appropriate units of measurement used to make the computations. In addition, the final rate distribution base (as defined in subsection 2) for each major function (organized research, instruction, etc., as described in Section A.1 functions of an institution) must contain all the programs or activities which utilize the indirect (F&A) costs allocated to that major function. At the time an indirect (F&A) cost proposal is submitted to a cognizant agency for indirect costs, each institution must describe the process it uses to ensure that Federal funds are not used to subsidize industry and foreign government funded programs.


Indirect (F&A) costs must be distributed to applicable Federal awards and other benefitting activities within each major function (see section A.1) on the basis of modified total direct costs (MTDC), consisting of all salaries and wages, fringe benefits, materials and supplies, services, travel, and up to the first $50,000 of each subaward (regardless of the period covered by the subaward). MTDC is defined in § 200.1. For this purpose, an indirect (F&A) cost rate should be determined for each of the separate indirect (F&A) cost pools developed pursuant to subsection 1. The rate in each case should be stated as the percentage which the amount of the particular indirect (F&A) cost pool is of the modified total direct costs identified with such pool.






A negotiated fixed amount in lieu of indirect (F&A) costs may be appropriate for self-contained, off-campus, or primarily subcontracted activities where the benefits derived from an institution's indirect (F&A) services cannot be readily determined. Such negotiated indirect (F&A) costs will be treated as an offset before allocation to instruction, organized research, other sponsored activities, and other institutional activities. The base on which such remaining expenses are allocated should be appropriately adjusted.
Public Law 87-638 (76 Stat. 437) as amended (41 U.S.C. 4708) authorizes the use of predetermined rates in determining the “indirect costs” (indirect (F&A) costs) applicable under research agreements with educational institutions. The stated objectives of the law are to simplify the administration of cost-type research and development contracts (including grants) with educational institutions, to facilitate the preparation of their budgets, and to permit more expeditious closeout of such contracts when the work is completed. In view of the potential advantages offered by this procedure, negotiation of predetermined rates for indirect (F&A) costs for a period of two to four years should be the norm in those situations where the cost experience and other pertinent facts available are deemed sufficient to enable the parties involved to reach an informed judgment as to the probable level of indirect (F&A) costs during the ensuing accounting periods.
When a fixed rate is negotiated in advance for a fiscal year (or other time period), the over- or under-recovery for that year may be included as an adjustment to the indirect (F&A) cost for the next rate negotiation. When the rate is negotiated before the carry-forward adjustment is determined, the carry-forward amount may be applied to the next subsequent rate negotiation. When such adjustments are to be made, each fixed rate negotiated in advance for a given period will be computed by applying the expected indirect (F&A) costs allocable to Federal awards for the forecast period plus or minus the carry-forward adjustment (over- or under-recovery) from the prior period, to the forecast distribution base. Unrecovered amounts under lump-sum agreements or cost-sharing provisions of prior years must not be carried forward for consideration in the new rate negotiation. There must, however, be an advance understanding in each case between the institution and the cognizant agency for indirect costs as to whether these differences will be considered in the rate negotiation rather than making the determination after the differences are known. Further, institutions electing to use this carry-forward provision may not subsequently change without prior approval of the cognizant agency for indirect costs. In the event that an institution returns to a post-determined rate, any over- or under-recovery during the period in which negotiated fixed rates and carry-forward provisions were followed will be included in the subsequent post-determined rates. Where multiple rates are used, the same procedure will be applicable for determining each rate.
Where the cognizant agency for indirect costs determines that cost experience and other pertinent facts do not justify the use of predetermined rates, or a fixed rate with a carry-forward, or if the parties cannot agree on an equitable rate, a provisional rate must be established. To prevent substantial overpayment or underpayment, the provisional rate may be adjusted by the cognizant agency for indirect costs during the institution's fiscal year. Predetermined or fixed rates may replace provisional rates at any time prior to the close of the institution's fiscal year. If a provisional rate is not replaced by a predetermined or fixed rate prior to the end of the institution's fiscal year, a final rate will be established and upward or downward adjustments will be made based on the actual allowable costs incurred for the period involved.


a. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of § 200.414, Federal agencies must use the negotiated rates in effect at the time of the initial award throughout the life of the Federal award. Award levels for Federal awards may not be adjusted in future years as a result of changes in negotiated rates. “Negotiated rates” per the rate agreement include final, fixed, and predetermined rates and exclude provisional rates. “Life” for the purpose of this subsection means each competitive segment of a project. A competitive segment is a period of years approved by the Federal awarding agency at the time of the Federal award. If negotiated rate agreements do not extend through the life of the Federal award at the time of the initial award, then the negotiated rate for the last year of the Federal award must be extended through the end of the life of the Federal award.
b. Except as provided in § 200.414, when an educational institution does not have a negotiated rate with the Federal Government at the time of an award (because the educational institution is a new recipient or the parties cannot reach agreement on a rate), the provisional rate used at the time of the award must be adjusted once a rate is negotiated and approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.


a. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection C.1.a, the administrative costs charged to Federal awards awarded or amended (including continuation and renewal awards) with effective dates beginning on or after the start of the institution's first fiscal year which begins on or after October 1, 1991, must be limited to 26% of modified total direct costs (as defined in subsection 2) for the total of General Administration and General Expenses, Departmental Administration, Sponsored Projects Administration, and Student Administration and Services (including their allocable share of depreciation, interest costs, operation and maintenance expenses, and fringe benefits costs, as provided by Section B, and all other types of expenditures not listed specifically under one of the subcategories of facilities in Section B.
b. Institutions should not change their accounting or cost allocation methods if the effect is to change the charging of a particular type of cost from F&A to direct, or to reclassify costs, or increase allocations from the administrative pools identified in paragraph B.1 of this Appendix to the other F&A cost pools or fringe benefits. Cognizant agencies for indirect cost are authorized to allow changes where an institution's charging practices are at variance with acceptable practices followed by a substantial majority of other institutions.
a. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection C.1.a, an institution may elect to claim a fixed allowance for the “Administration” portion of indirect (F&A) costs. The allowance could be either 24% of modified total direct costs or a percentage equal to 95% of the most recently negotiated fixed or predetermined rate for the cost pools included under “Administration” as defined in Section B.1, whichever is less. Under this alternative, no cost proposal need be prepared for the “Administration” portion of the indirect (F&A) cost rate nor is further identification or documentation of these costs required (see subsection c). Where a negotiated indirect (F&A) cost agreement includes this alternative, an institution must make no further charges for the expenditure categories described in Section B.5, Section B.6, Section B.7, and Section B.9.
b. In negotiations of rates for subsequent periods, an institution that has elected the option of subsection a may continue to exercise it at the same rate without further identification or documentation of costs.
c. If an institution elects to accept a threshold rate as defined in subsection a of this section, it is not required to perform a detailed analysis of its administrative costs. However, in order to compute the facilities components of its indirect (F&A) cost rate, the institution must reconcile its indirect (F&A) cost proposal to its financial statements and make appropriate adjustments and reclassifications to identify the costs of each major function as defined in Section A.1, as well as to identify and allocate the facilities components. Administrative costs that are not identified as such by the institution's accounting system (such as those incurred in academic departments) will be classified as instructional costs for purposes of reconciling indirect (F&A) cost proposals to financial statements and allocating facilities costs.
In order to provide mutually agreed-upon information for management purposes, each indirect (F&A) cost rate negotiation or determination must include development of a rate for each indirect (F&A) cost pool as well as the overall indirect (F&A) cost rate.


a. Cognizant agency for indirect costs is defined in Subpart A.
(1) Cost negotiation cognizance is assigned to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or the Department of Defense's Office of Naval Research (DOD), normally depending on which of the two agencies (HHS or DOD) provides more funds directly to the educational institution for the most recent three years. Information on funding must be derived from relevant data gathered by the National Science Foundation. In cases where neither HHS nor DOD provides Federal funding directly to an educational institution, the cognizant agency for indirect costs assignment must default to HHS. Notwithstanding the method for cognizance determination described in this section, other arrangements for cognizance of a particular educational institution may also be based in part on the types of research performed at the educational institution and must be decided based on mutual agreement between HHS and DOD. Where a non-Federal entity only receives funds as a subrecipient, see § 200.332.
(2) After cognizance is established, it must continue for a five-year period.
b. Acceptance of rates. See § 200.414.
c. Correcting deficiencies. The cognizant agency for indirect costs must negotiate changes needed to correct systems deficiencies relating to accountability for Federal awards. Cognizant agencies for indirect costs must address the concerns of other affected agencies, as appropriate, and must negotiate special rates for Federal agencies that are required to limit recovery of indirect costs by statute.
d. Resolving questioned costs. The cognizant agency for indirect costs must conduct any necessary negotiations with an educational institution regarding amounts questioned by audit that are due the Federal Government related to costs covered by a negotiated agreement.
e. Reimbursement. Reimbursement to cognizant agencies for indirect costs for work performed under this Part may be made by reimbursement billing under the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. 1535.
f. Procedure for establishing facilities and administrative rates must be established by one of the following methods:
(1) Formal negotiation. The cognizant agency for indirect costs is responsible for negotiating and approving rates for an educational institution on behalf of all Federal agencies. Federal awarding agencies that do not have cognizance for indirect costs must notify the cognizant agency for indirect costs of specific concerns (i.e., a need to establish special cost rates) which could affect the negotiation process. The cognizant agency for indirect costs must address the concerns of all interested agencies, as appropriate. A pre-negotiation conference may be scheduled among all interested agencies, if necessary. The cognizant agency for indirect costs must then arrange a negotiation conference with the educational institution.
(2) Other than formal negotiation. The cognizant agency for indirect costs and educational institution may reach an agreement on rates without a formal negotiation conference; for example, through correspondence or use of the simplified method described in this section D of this Appendix.
g. Formalizing determinations and agreements. The cognizant agency for indirect costs must formalize all determinations or agreements reached with an educational institution and provide copies to other agencies having an interest. Determinations should include a description of any adjustments, the actual amount, both dollar and percentage adjusted, and the reason for making adjustments.
h. Disputes and disagreements. Where the cognizant agency for indirect costs is unable to reach agreement with an educational institution with regard to rates or audit resolution, the appeal system of the cognizant agency for indirect costs must be followed for resolution of the disagreement.
For facilities and administrative (indirect (F&A)) rate proposals, educational institutions must use the standard format, shown in section E of this appendix, to submit their indirect (F&A) rate proposal to the cognizant agency for indirect costs. The cognizant agency for indirect costs may, on an institution-by-institution basis, grant exceptions from all or portions of Part II of the standard format requirement. This requirement does not apply to educational institutions that use the simplified method for calculating indirect (F&A) rates, as described in Section D of this Appendix.
As provided in section C.10 of this appendix, each F&A cost rate negotiation or determination must include development of a rate for each F&A cost pool as well as the overall F&A rate.
a. Where the total direct cost of work covered by this Part at an institution does not exceed $10 million in a fiscal year, the simplified procedure described in subsections 2 or 3 may be used in determining allowable indirect (F&A) costs. Under this simplified procedure, the institution's most recent annual financial report and immediately available supporting information must be utilized as a basis for determining the indirect (F&A) cost rate applicable to all Federal awards. The institution may use either the salaries and wages (see subsection 2) or modified total direct costs (see subsection 3) as the distribution basis.
b. The simplified procedure should not be used where it produces results which appear inequitable to the Federal Government or the institution. In any such case, indirect (F&A) costs should be determined through use of the regular procedure.
a. Establish the total amount of salaries and wages paid to all employees of the institution.
b. Establish an indirect (F&A) cost pool consisting of the expenditures (exclusive of capital items and other costs specifically identified as unallowable) which customarily are classified under the following titles or their equivalents:
(1) General administration and general expenses (exclusive of costs of student administration and services, student activities, student aid, and scholarships).
(2) Operation and maintenance of physical plant and depreciation (after appropriate adjustment for costs applicable to other institutional activities).
(3) Library.
(4) Department administration expenses, which will be computed as 20 percent of the salaries and expenses of deans and heads of departments.
In those cases where expenditures classified under subsection (1) have previously been allocated to other institutional activities, they may be included in the indirect (F&A) cost pool. The total amount of salaries and wages included in the indirect (F&A) cost pool must be separately identified.
c. Establish a salary and wage distribution base, determined by deducting from the total of salaries and wages as established in subsection a from the amount of salaries and wages included under subsection b.
d. Establish the indirect (F&A) cost rate, determined by dividing the amount in the indirect (F&A) cost pool, subsection b, by the amount of the distribution base, subsection c.
e. Apply the indirect (F&A) cost rate to direct salaries and wages for individual agreements to determine the amount of indirect (F&A) costs allocable to such agreements.
a. Establish the total costs incurred by the institution for the base period.
b. Establish an indirect (F&A) cost pool consisting of the expenditures (exclusive of capital items and other costs specifically identified as unallowable) which customarily are classified under the following titles or their equivalents:
(1) General administration and general expenses (exclusive of costs of student administration and services, student activities, student aid, and scholarships).
(2) Operation and maintenance of physical plant and depreciation (after appropriate adjustment for costs applicable to other institutional activities).
(3) Library.
(4) Department administration expenses, which will be computed as 20 percent of the salaries and expenses of deans and heads of departments. In those cases where expenditures classified under subsection (1) have previously been allocated to other institutional activities, they may be included in the indirect (F&A) cost pool. The modified total direct costs amount included in the indirect (F&A) cost pool must be separately identified.
c. Establish a modified total direct cost distribution base, as defined in Section C.2, The distribution basis, that consists of all institution's direct functions.
d. Establish the indirect (F&A) cost rate, determined by dividing the amount in the indirect (F&A) cost pool, subsection b, by the amount of the distribution base, subsection c.
e. Apply the indirect (F&A) cost rate to the modified total direct costs for individual agreements to determine the amount of indirect (F&A) costs allocable to such agreements.


The standard format for documentation requirements for indirect (indirect (F&A)) rate proposals for claiming costs under the regular method is available on the OMB website.


To assure that expenditures for Federal awards are proper and in accordance with the agreement documents and approved project budgets, the annual and/or final fiscal reports or vouchers requesting payment under the agreements will include a certification, signed by an authorized official of the university, which reads “By signing this report, I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that the report is true, complete, and accurate, and the expenditures, disbursements and cash receipts are for the purposes and intent set forth in the award documents. I am aware that any false, fictitious, or fraudulent information, or the omission of any material fact, may subject me to criminal, civil or administrative penalties for fraud, false statements, false claims or otherwise. (U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1001 and Title 31, Sections 3729-3733 and 3801-3812)”.
a.  Cognizant agencies must not accept a proposed indirect cost rate unless such costs have been certified by the educational institution using the Certificate of indirect (F&A) Costs set forth in subsection F.2.c
Policy.b. The certificate must be signed on behalf of the institution by the chief financial officer or an individual designated by an individual at a level no lower than vice president or chief financial officer.
An indirect (F&A) cost rate is not binding upon the Federal Government if the most recent required proposal from the institution has not been certified. Where it is necessary to establish indirect (F&A) cost rates, and the institution has not submitted a certified proposal for establishing such rates in accordance with the requirements of this section, the Federal Government must unilaterally establish such rates. Such rates may be based upon audited historical data or such other data that have been furnished to the cognizant agency for indirect costs and for which it can be demonstrated that all unallowable costs have been excluded. When indirect (F&A) cost rates are unilaterally established by the Federal Government because of failure of the institution to submit a certified proposal for establishing such rates in accordance with this section, the rates established will be set at a level low enough to ensure that potentially unallowable costs will not be reimbursed.
c.  The certificate required by this section must be in the following form:
Certificate.This is to certify that to the best of my knowledge and belief:
(1) I have reviewed the indirect (F&A) cost proposal submitted herewith;
(2) All costs included in this proposal [identify date] to establish billing or final indirect (F&A) costs rate for [identify period covered by rate] are allowable in accordance with the requirements of the Federal agreement(s) to which they apply and with the cost principles applicable to those agreements.
(3) This proposal does not include any costs which are unallowable under subpart E of this part such as (without limitation): Public relations costs, contributions and donations, entertainment costs, fines and penalties, lobbying costs, and defense of fraud proceedings; and
(4) All costs included in this proposal are properly allocable to Federal agreements on the basis of a beneficial or causal relationship between the expenses incurred and the agreements to which they are allocated in accordance with applicable requirements.
I declare that the foregoing is true and correct.

NAppendix IV to Part 200APPENDIX1Appendix IV to Part 200—Indirect (F&A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination for Nonprofit Organizations




A. General
B. Allocation of Indirect Costs and Determination of Indirect Cost Rates
C. Negotiation and Approval of Indirect Cost Rates
1. Indirect costs are those that have been incurred for common or joint objectives and cannot be readily identified with a particular final cost objective. Direct cost of minor amounts may be treated as indirect costs under the conditions described in § 200.413(d). After direct costs have been determined and assigned directly to awards or other work as appropriate, indirect costs are those remaining to be allocated to benefitting cost objectives. A cost may not be allocated to a Federal award as an indirect cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose, in like circumstances, has been assigned to a Federal award as a direct cost.
2. “Major nonprofit organizations” are defined in paragraph (a) of § 200.414. See indirect cost rate reporting requirements in sections B.2.e and B.3.g of this Appendix.


a. If a nonprofit organization has only one major function, or where all its major functions benefit from its indirect costs to approximately the same degree, the allocation of indirect costs and the computation of an indirect cost rate may be accomplished through simplified allocation procedures, as described in section B.2 of this Appendix.
b. If an organization has several major functions which benefit from its indirect costs in varying degrees, allocation of indirect costs may require the accumulation of such costs into separate cost groupings which then are allocated individually to benefitting functions by means of a base which best measures the relative degree of benefit. The indirect costs allocated to each function are then distributed to individual Federal awards and other activities included in that function by means of an indirect cost rate(s).
c. The determination of what constitutes an organization's major functions will depend on its purpose in being; the types of services it renders to the public, its clients, and its members; and the amount of effort it devotes to such activities as fundraising, public information and membership activities.
d. Specific methods for allocating indirect costs and computing indirect cost rates along with the conditions under which each method should be used are described in section B.2 through B.5 of this Appendix.
e. The base period for the allocation of indirect costs is the period in which such costs are incurred and accumulated for allocation to work performed in that period. The base period normally should coincide with the organization's fiscal year but, in any event, must be so selected as to avoid inequities in the allocation of the costs.


a. Where an organization's major functions benefit from its indirect costs to approximately the same degree, the allocation of indirect costs may be accomplished by (i) separating the organization's total costs for the base period as either direct or indirect, and (ii) dividing the total allowable indirect costs (net of applicable credits) by an equitable distribution base. The result of this process is an indirect cost rate which is used to distribute indirect costs to individual Federal awards. The rate should be expressed as the percentage which the total amount of allowable indirect costs bears to the base selected. This method should also be used where an organization has only one major function encompassing a number of individual projects or activities, and may be used where the level of Federal awards to an organization is relatively small.
b. Both the direct costs and the indirect costs must exclude capital expenditures and unallowable costs. However, unallowable costs which represent activities must be included in the direct costs under the conditions described in § 200.413(e).
c. The distribution base may be total direct costs (excluding capital expenditures and other distorting items, such as subawards for $50,000 or more), direct salaries and wages, or other base which results in an equitable distribution. The distribution base must exclude participant support costs as defined in § 200.1.








d. Except where a special rate(s) is required in accordance with section B.5 of this Appendix, the indirect cost rate developed under the above principles is applicable to all Federal awards of the organization. If a special rate(s) is required, appropriate modifications must be made in order to develop the special rate(s).
e. For an organization that receives more than $10 million in direct Federal funding in a fiscal year, a breakout of the indirect cost component into two broad categories, Facilities and Administration as defined in paragraph (a) of § 200.414, is required. The rate in each case must be stated as the percentage which the amount of the particular indirect cost category ( Facilities or Administration) is of the distribution base identified with that category.


i.e.,a. General. Where an organization's indirect costs benefit its major functions in varying degrees, indirect costs must be accumulated into separate cost groupings, as described in subparagraph b. Each grouping must then be allocated individually to benefitting functions by means of a base which best measures the relative benefits. The default allocation bases by cost pool are described in section B.3.c of this Appendix.
b. Identification of indirect costs. Cost groupings must be established so as to permit the allocation of each grouping on the basis of benefits provided to the major functions. Each grouping must constitute a pool of expenses that are of like character in terms of functions they benefit and in terms of the allocation base which best measures the relative benefits provided to each function. The groupings are classified within the two broad categories: “Facilities” and “Administration,” as described in section A.3 of this Appendix. The indirect cost pools are defined as follows:
(1) Depreciation. The expenses under this heading are the portion of the costs of the organization's buildings, capital improvements to land and buildings, and equipment which are computed in accordance with § 200.436.
(2) Interest. Interest on debt associated with certain buildings, equipment and capital improvements are computed in accordance with § 200.449.
(3) Operation and maintenance expenses. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for the administration, operation, maintenance, preservation, and protection of the organization's physical plant. They include expenses normally incurred for such items as: janitorial and utility services; repairs and ordinary or normal alterations of buildings, furniture and equipment; care of grounds; maintenance and operation of buildings and other plant facilities; security; earthquake and disaster preparedness; environmental safety; hazardous waste disposal; property, liability and other insurance relating to property; space and capital leasing; facility planning and management; and central receiving. The operation and maintenance expenses category must also include its allocable share of fringe benefit costs, depreciation, and interest costs.
(4) General administration and general expenses. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred for the overall general executive and administrative offices of the organization and other expenses of a general nature which do not relate solely to any major function of the organization. This category must also include its allocable share of fringe benefit costs, operation and maintenance expense, depreciation, and interest costs. Examples of this category include central offices, such as the director's office, the office of finance, business services, budget and planning, personnel, safety and risk management, general counsel, management information systems, and library costs.
In developing this cost pool, special care should be exercised to ensure that costs incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances are treated consistently as either direct or indirect costs. For example, salaries of technical staff, project supplies, project publication, telephone toll charges, computer costs, travel costs, and specialized services costs must be treated as direct costs wherever identifiable to a particular program. The salaries and wages of administrative and pooled clerical staff should normally be treated as indirect costs. Direct charging of these costs may be appropriate as described in § 200.413. Items such as office supplies, postage, local telephone costs, periodicals and memberships should normally be treated as indirect costs.
c. Allocation bases. Actual conditions must be taken into account in selecting the base to be used in allocating the expenses in each grouping to benefitting functions. The essential consideration in selecting a method or a base is that it is the one best suited for assigning the pool of costs to cost objectives in accordance with benefits derived; a traceable cause and effect relationship; or logic and reason, where neither the cause nor the effect of the relationship is determinable. When an allocation can be made by assignment of a cost grouping directly to the function benefitted, the allocation must be made in that manner. When the expenses in a cost grouping are more general in nature, the allocation must be made through the use of a selected base which produces results that are equitable to both the Federal Government and the organization. The distribution must be made in accordance with the bases described herein unless it can be demonstrated that the use of a different base would result in a more equitable allocation of the costs, or that a more readily available base would not increase the costs charged to Federal awards. The results of special cost studies (such as an engineering utility study) must not be used to determine and allocate the indirect costs to Federal awards.
(1) Depreciation. Depreciation expenses must be allocated in the following manner:
(a) Depreciation on buildings used exclusively in the conduct of a single function, and on capital improvements and equipment used in such buildings, must be assigned to that function.
(b) Depreciation on buildings used for more than one function, and on capital improvements and equipment used in such buildings, must be allocated to the individual functions performed in each building on the basis of usable square feet of space, excluding common areas, such as hallways, stairwells, and restrooms.
(c) Depreciation on buildings, capital improvements and equipment related space (e.g., individual rooms, and laboratories) used jointly by more than one function (as determined by the users of the space) must be treated as follows. The cost of each jointly used unit of space must be allocated to the benefitting functions on the basis of:
(i) the employees and other users on a full-time equivalent (FTE) basis or salaries and wages of those individual functions benefitting from the use of that space; or
(ii) organization-wide employee FTEs or salaries and wages applicable to the benefitting functions of the organization.
(d) Depreciation on certain capital improvements to land, such as paved parking areas, fences, sidewalks, and the like, not included in the cost of buildings, must be allocated to user categories on a FTE basis and distributed to major functions in proportion to the salaries and wages of all employees applicable to the functions.
(2) Interest. Interest costs must be allocated in the same manner as the depreciation on the buildings, equipment and capital equipment to which the interest relates.
(3) Operation and maintenance expenses. Operation and maintenance expenses must be allocated in the same manner as the depreciation.
(4) General administration and general expenses. General administration and general expenses must be allocated to benefitting functions based on modified total costs (MTC). The MTC is the modified total direct costs (MTDC), as described in § 200.1, plus the allocated indirect cost proportion. The expenses included in this category could be grouped first according to major functions of the organization to which they render services or provide benefits. The aggregate expenses of each group must then be allocated to benefitting functions based on MTC.
d. Order of distribution.
(1) Indirect cost categories consisting of depreciation, interest, operation and maintenance, and general administration and general expenses must be allocated in that order to the remaining indirect cost categories as well as to the major functions of the organization. Other cost categories should be allocated in the order determined to be most appropriate by the organization. This order of allocation does not apply if cross allocation of costs is made as provided in section B.3.d.2 of this Appendix.
(2) Normally, an indirect cost category will be considered closed once it has been allocated to other cost objectives, and costs must not be subsequently allocated to it. However, a cross allocation of costs between two or more indirect costs categories could be used if such allocation will result in a more equitable allocation of costs. If a cross allocation is used, an appropriate modification to the composition of the indirect cost categories is required.
e. Application of indirect cost rate or rates. Except where a special indirect cost rate(s) is required in accordance with section B.5 of this Appendix, the separate groupings of indirect costs allocated to each major function must be aggregated and treated as a common pool for that function. The costs in the common pool must then be distributed to individual Federal awards included in that function by use of a single indirect cost rate.
f. Distribution basis. Indirect costs must be distributed to applicable Federal awards and other benefitting activities within each major function on the basis of MTDC (see definition in § 200.1).
g. Individual Rate Components. An indirect cost rate must be determined for each separate indirect cost pool developed. The rate in each case must be stated as the percentage which the amount of the particular indirect cost pool is of the distribution base identified with that pool. Each indirect cost rate negotiation or determination agreement must include development of the rate for each indirect cost pool as well as the overall indirect cost rate. The indirect cost pools must be classified within two broad categories: “Facilities” and “Administration,” as described in § 200.414(a).


a. Some nonprofit organizations treat all costs as direct costs except general administration and general expenses. These organizations generally separate their costs into three basic categories: (i) General administration and general expenses, (ii) fundraising, and 



(iii) other direct functions (including projects performed under Federal awards). Joint costs, such as depreciation, rental costs, operation and maintenance of facilities, telephone expenses, information technology, and the like are prorated individually as direct costs to each category and to each Federal award or other activity using a base most appropriate to the particular cost being prorated.


b. This method is acceptable, provided each joint cost is prorated using a base which accurately measures the benefits provided to each Federal award or other activity. The bases must be established in accordance with reasonable criteria and be supported by current data. This method is compatible with the Standards of Accounting and Financial Reporting for Voluntary Health and Welfare Organizations issued jointly by the National Health Council, Inc., the National Assembly of Voluntary Health and Social Welfare Organizations, and the United Way of America.
c. Under this method, indirect costs consist exclusively of general administration and general expenses. In all other respects, the organization's indirect cost rates must be computed in the same manner as that described in section B.2 of this Appendix.


In some instances, a single indirect cost rate for all activities of an organization or for each major function of the organization may not be appropriate, since it would not take into account those different factors which may substantially affect the indirect costs applicable to a particular segment of work. For this purpose, a particular segment of work may be that performed under a single Federal award or it may consist of work under a group of Federal awards performed in a common environment. These factors may include the physical location of the work, the level of administrative support required, the nature of the facilities or other resources employed, the scientific disciplines or technical skills involved, the organizational arrangements used, or any combination thereof. When a particular segment of work is performed in an environment which appears to generate a significantly different level of indirect costs, provisions should be made for a separate indirect cost pool applicable to such work. The separate indirect cost pool should be developed during the course of the regular allocation process, and the separate indirect cost rate resulting therefrom should be used, provided it is determined that (i) the rate differs significantly from that which would have been obtained under sections B.2, B.3, and B.4 of this Appendix, and (ii) the volume of work to which the rate would apply is material.
As used in this section, the following terms have the meanings set forth in this section:
a.  means the Federal agency responsible for negotiating and approving indirect cost rates for a nonprofit organization on behalf of all Federal agencies.
Cognizant agency for indirect costsb.  means an indirect cost rate, applicable to a specified current or future period, usually the organization's fiscal year. The rate is based on an estimate of the costs to be incurred during the period. A predetermined rate is not subject to adjustment.
Predetermined ratec.  means an indirect cost rate which has the same characteristics as a predetermined rate, except that the difference between the estimated costs and the actual costs of the period covered by the rate is carried forward as an adjustment to the rate computation of a subsequent period.
Fixed rated.  means an indirect cost rate applicable to a specified past period which is based on the actual costs of the period. A final rate is not subject to adjustment.
Final ratee.  means a temporary indirect cost rate applicable to a specified period which is used for funding, interim reimbursement, and reporting indirect costs on Federal awards pending the establishment of a final rate for the period.
Provisional rate or billing ratef.  means the documentation prepared by an organization to substantiate its claim for the reimbursement of indirect costs. This proposal provides the basis for the review and negotiation leading to the establishment of an organization's indirect cost rate.
Indirect cost proposalg.  means a function, organizational subdivision, contract, Federal award, or other work unit for which cost data are desired and for which provision is made to accumulate and measure the cost of processes, projects, jobs and capitalized projects.


Cost objectivea. Unless different arrangements are agreed to by the Federal agencies concerned, the Federal agency with the largest dollar value of Federal awards directly funded to an organization will be designated as the cognizant agency for indirect costs for the negotiation and approval of the indirect cost rates and, where necessary, other rates such as fringe benefit and computer charge-out rates. Once an agency is assigned cognizance for a particular nonprofit organization, the assignment will not be changed unless there is a shift in the dollar volume of the Federal awards directly funded to the organization for at least three years. All concerned Federal agencies must be given the opportunity to participate in the negotiation process but, after a rate has been agreed upon, it will be accepted by all Federal agencies. When a Federal agency has reason to believe that special operating factors affecting its Federal awards necessitate special indirect cost rates in accordance with section B.5 of this Appendix, it will, prior to the time the rates are negotiated, notify the cognizant agency for indirect costs. (See also § 200.414.) If the nonprofit does not receive any funding from any Federal agency, the pass-through entity is responsible for the negotiation of the indirect cost rates in accordance with § 200.332(a)(4).
b. Except as otherwise provided in § 200.414(f), a nonprofit organization which has not previously established an indirect cost rate with a Federal agency must submit its initial indirect cost proposal immediately after the organization is advised that a Federal award will be made and, in no event, later than three months after the effective date of the Federal award.
c. Unless approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs in accordance with § 200.414(g), organizations that have previously established indirect cost rates must submit a new indirect cost proposal to the cognizant agency for indirect costs within six months after the close of each fiscal year.
d. A predetermined rate may be negotiated for use on Federal awards where there is reasonable assurance, based on past experience and reliable projection of the organization's costs, that the rate is not likely to exceed a rate based on the organization's actual costs.
e. Fixed rates may be negotiated where predetermined rates are not considered appropriate. A fixed rate, however, must not be negotiated if (i) all or a substantial portion of the organization's Federal awards are expected to expire before the carry-forward adjustment can be made; (ii) the mix of Federal and non-Federal work at the organization is too erratic to permit an equitable carry-forward adjustment; or (iii) the organization's operations fluctuate significantly from year to year.
f. Provisional and final rates must be negotiated where neither predetermined nor fixed rates are appropriate. Predetermined or fixed rates may replace provisional rates at any time prior to the close of the organization's fiscal year. If that event does not occur, a final rate will be established and upward or downward adjustments will be made based on the actual allowable costs incurred for the period involved.
g. The results of each negotiation must be formalized in a written agreement between the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the nonprofit organization. The cognizant agency for indirect costs must make available copies of the agreement to all concerned Federal agencies.
h. If a dispute arises in a negotiation of an indirect cost rate between the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the nonprofit organization, the dispute must be resolved in accordance with the appeals procedures of the cognizant agency for indirect costs.
i. To the extent that problems are encountered among the Federal agencies in connection with the negotiation and approval process, OMB will lend assistance as required to resolve such problems in a timely manner.
(1) Required Certification. No proposal to establish indirect (F&A) cost rates must be acceptable unless such costs have been certified by the nonprofit organization using the Certificate of Indirect (F&A) Costs set forth in section j. of this appendix. The certificate must be signed on behalf of the organization by an individual at a level no lower than vice president or chief financial officer for the organization.
(2) Each indirect cost rate proposal must be accompanied by a certification in the following form:
This is to certify that to the best of my knowledge and belief:
(1) I have reviewed the indirect (F&A) cost proposal submitted herewith;
(2) All costs included in this proposal [identify date] to establish billing or final indirect (F&A) costs rate for [identify period covered by rate] are allowable in accordance with the requirements of the Federal awards to which they apply and with subpart E of this part.
(3) This proposal does not include any costs which are unallowable under subpart E of this part such as (without limitation): Public relations costs, contributions and donations, entertainment costs, fines and penalties, lobbying costs, and defense of fraud proceedings; and
(4) All costs included in this proposal are properly allocable to Federal awards on the basis of a beneficial or causal relationship between the expenses incurred and the Federal awards to which they are allocated in accordance with applicable requirements.
I declare that the foregoing is true and correct.

D. Submission Requirements
E. Documentation Requirements for Submitted Plans
F. Negotiation and Approval of Central Service Plans
G. Other Policies
1. Most governmental units provide certain services, such as motor pools, computer centers, purchasing, accounting, etc., to operating agencies on a centralized basis. Since federally-supported awards are performed within the individual operating agencies, there needs to be a process whereby these central service costs can be identified and assigned to benefitted activities on a reasonable and consistent basis. The central service cost allocation plan provides that process. All costs and other data used to distribute the costs included in the plan should be supported by formal accounting and other records that will support the propriety of the costs assigned to Federal awards.
2. Guidelines and illustrations of central service cost allocation plans are provided in a brochure published by the Department of Health and Human Services entitled “ A copy of this brochure may be obtained from the HHS Cost Allocation Services or at their website.
A Guide for State, Local and Indian Tribal Governments: Cost Principles and Procedures for Developing Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Rates for Agreements with the Federal Government.”1.  means an organizational unit or sub-division within a governmental unit that is responsible for the performance or administration of Federal awards or activities of the governmental unit.
Agency or operating agency2.  means central services that benefit operating agencies but are not billed to the agencies on a fee-for-service or similar basis. These costs are allocated to benefitted agencies on some reasonable basis. Examples of such services might include general accounting, personnel administration, purchasing, etc.
Allocated central services3.  means central services that are billed to benefitted agencies or programs on an individual fee-for-service or similar basis. Typical examples of billed central services include computer services, transportation services, insurance, and fringe benefits.
Billed central services4.  is defined in § 200.1. The determination of cognizant agency for indirect costs for states and local governments is described in section F.1.
Cognizant agency for indirect costs5.  means local government that receives more than $100 million in direct Federal awards subject to this Part.
Major local governmentThe central service cost allocation plan will include all central service costs that will be claimed (either as a billed or an allocated cost) under Federal awards and will be documented as described in section E. omitted from the plan will not be reimbursed.
1. Each state will submit a plan to the Department of Health and Human Services for each year in which it claims central service costs under Federal awards. The plan should include (a) a projection of the next year's allocated central service cost (based either on actual costs for the most recently completed year or the budget projection for the coming year), and (b) a reconciliation of actual allocated central service costs to the estimated costs used for either the most recently completed year or the year immediately preceding the most recently completed year.
2. Each major local government is also required to submit a plan to its cognizant agency for indirect costs annually.
3. All other local governments claiming central service costs must develop a plan in accordance with the requirements described in this Part and maintain the plan and related supporting documentation for audit. These local governments are not required to submit their plans for Federal approval unless they are specifically requested to do so by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. Where a local government only receives funds as a subrecipient, the pass-through entity will be responsible for monitoring the subrecipient's plan.
4. All central service cost allocation plans will be prepared and, when required, submitted within six months prior to the beginning of each of the governmental unit's fiscal years in which it proposes to claim central service costs. Extensions may be granted by the cognizant agency for indirect costs on a case-by-case basis.
The documentation requirements described in this section may be modified, expanded, or reduced by the cognizant agency for indirect costs on a case-by-case basis. For example, the requirements may be reduced for those central services which have little or no impact on Federal awards. Conversely, if a review of a plan indicates that certain additional information is needed, and will likely be needed in future years, it may be routinely requested in future plan submissions. Items marked with an asterisk (*) should be submitted only once; subsequent plans should merely indicate any changes since the last plan.
All proposed plans must be accompanied by the following: an organization chart sufficiently detailed to show operations including the central service activities of the state/local government whether or not they are shown as benefitting from central service functions; a copy of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (or a copy of the Executive Budget if budgeted costs are being proposed) to support the allowable costs of each central service activity included in the plan; and, a certification (see subsection 4.) that the plan was prepared in accordance with this Part, contains only allowable costs, and was prepared in a manner that treated similar costs consistently among the various Federal awards and between Federal and non-Federal awards/activities.
For each allocated central service*, the plan must also include the following: a brief description of the service, an identification of the unit rendering the service and the operating agencies receiving the service, the items of expense included in the cost of the service, the method used to distribute the cost of the service to benefitted agencies, and a summary schedule showing the allocation of each service to the specific benefitted agencies. If any self-insurance funds or fringe benefits costs are treated as allocated (rather than billed) central services, documentation discussed in subsections 3.b. and c. must also be included.
a.  The information described in this section must be provided for all billed central services, including internal service funds, self-insurance funds, and fringe benefit funds.
General.b. Internal service funds.
(1) For each internal service fund or similar activity with an operating budget of $5 million or more, the plan must include: A brief description of each service; a balance sheet for each fund based on individual accounts contained in the governmental unit's accounting system; a revenue/expenses statement, with revenues broken out by source,  regular billings, interest earned, etc.; a listing of all non-operating transfers (as defined by GAAP) into and out of the fund; a description of the procedures (methodology) used to charge the costs of each service to users, including how billing rates are determined; a schedule of current rates; and, a schedule comparing total revenues (including imputed revenues) generated by the service to the allowable costs of the service, as determined under this part, with an explanation of how variances will be handled.
e.g.,(2) Revenues must consist of all revenues generated by the service, including unbilled and uncollected revenues. If some users were not billed for the services (or were not billed at the full rate for that class of users), a schedule showing the full imputed revenues associated with these users must be provided. Expenses must be broken out by object cost categories (e.g., salaries, supplies, etc.).
c.  For each self-insurance fund, the plan must include: the fund balance sheet; a statement of revenue and expenses including a summary of billings and claims paid by agency; a listing of all non-operating transfers into and out of the fund; the type(s) of risk(s) covered by the fund (e.g., automobile liability, workers' compensation, etc.); an explanation of how the level of fund contributions are determined, including a copy of the current actuarial report (with the actuarial assumptions used) if the contributions are determined on an actuarial basis; and, a description of the procedures used to charge or allocate fund contributions to benefitted activities. Reserve levels in excess of claims (1) submitted and adjudicated but not paid, (2) submitted but not adjudicated, and (3) incurred but not submitted must be identified and explained.
Self-insurance funds.d.  For fringe benefit costs, the plan must include: a listing of fringe benefits provided to covered employees, and the overall annual cost of each type of benefit; current fringe benefit policies; and procedures used to charge or allocate the costs of the benefits to benefitted activities. In addition, for pension and post-retirement health insurance plans, the following information must be provided: the governmental unit's funding policies, e.g., legislative bills, trust agreements, or state-mandated contribution rules, if different from actuarially determined rates; the pension plan's costs accrued for the year; the amount funded, and date(s) of funding; a copy of the current actuarial report (including the actuarial assumptions); the plan trustee's report; and, a schedule from the activity showing the value of the interest cost associated with late funding.
Fringe benefits.Each central service cost allocation plan will be accompanied by a certification in the following form:
This is to certify that I have reviewed the cost allocation plan submitted herewith and to the best of my knowledge and belief:
(1) All costs included in this proposal [identify date] to establish cost allocations or billings for [identify period covered by plan] are allowable in accordance with the requirements of this Part and the Federal award(s) to which they apply. Unallowable costs have been adjusted for in allocating costs as indicated in the cost allocation plan.
(2) All costs included in this proposal are properly allocable to Federal awards on the basis of a beneficial or causal relationship between the expenses incurred and the Federal awards to which they are allocated in accordance with applicable requirements. Further, the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs have not been claimed as direct costs. Similar types of costs have been accounted for consistently.
In general, unless different arrangements are agreed to by the concerned Federal agencies, for central service cost allocation plans, the cognizant agency responsible for review and approval is the Federal agency with the largest dollar value of total Federal awards with a governmental unit. For indirect cost rates and departmental indirect cost allocation plans, the cognizant agency is the Federal agency with the largest dollar value of direct Federal awards with a governmental unit or component, as appropriate. Once designated as the cognizant agency for indirect costs, the Federal agency must remain so for a period of five years. In addition, the following Federal agencies continue to be responsible for the indicated governmental entities:
—Public assistance and state-wide cost allocation plans for all states (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico), state and local hospitals, libraries and health districts.
Department of Health and Human Services—Indian tribal governments, territorial governments, and state and local park and recreational districts.
Department of the Interior—State and local labor departments.
Department of Labor—School districts and state and local education agencies.
Department of Education—State and local agriculture departments.
Department of Agriculture—State and local airport and port authorities and transit districts.
Department of Transportation—State and local economic development districts.
Department of Commerce—State and local housing and development districts.
Department of Housing and Urban Development—State and local water and sewer districts.
Environmental Protection AgencyAll proposed central service cost allocation plans that are required to be submitted will be reviewed, negotiated, and approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs on a timely basis. The cognizant agency for indirect costs will review the proposal within six months of receipt of the proposal and either negotiate/approve the proposal or advise the governmental unit of the additional documentation needed to support/evaluate the proposed plan or the changes required to make the proposal acceptable. Once an agreement with the governmental unit has been reached, the agreement will be accepted and used by all Federal agencies, unless prohibited or limited by statute. Where a Federal awarding agency has reason to believe that special operating factors affecting its Federal awards necessitate special consideration, the funding agency will, prior to the time the plans are negotiated, notify the cognizant agency for indirect costs.
The results of each negotiation must be formalized in a written agreement between the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the governmental unit. This agreement will be subject to re-opening if the agreement is subsequently found to violate a statute or the information upon which the plan was negotiated is later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate. The results of the negotiation must be made available to all Federal agencies for their use.
Negotiated cost allocation plans based on a proposal later found to have included costs that: (a) are unallowable (i) as specified by law or regulation, (ii) as identified in subpart F, General Provisions for selected Items of Cost of this Part, or (iii) by the terms and conditions of Federal awards, or (b) are unallowable because they are clearly not allocable to Federal awards, must be adjusted, or a refund must be made at the option of the cognizant agency for indirect costs, including earned or imputed interest from the date of transfer and debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with applicable Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs regulations. Adjustments or cash refunds may include, at the option of the cognizant agency for indirect costs, earned or imputed interest from the date of expenditure and delinquent debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with applicable cognizant agency claims collection regulations. These adjustments or refunds are designed to correct the plans and do not constitute a reopening of the negotiation.
Each billed central service activity must separately account for all revenues (including imputed revenues) generated by the service, expenses incurred to furnish the service, and profit/loss.
Internal service funds are dependent upon a reasonable level of working capital reserve to operate from one billing cycle to the next. Charges by an internal service activity to provide for the establishment and maintenance of a reasonable level of working capital reserve, in addition to the full recovery of costs, are allowable. A working capital reserve as part of retained earnings of up to 60 calendar days cash expenses for normal operating purposes is considered reasonable. A working capital reserve exceeding 60 calendar days may be approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs in exceptional cases.
Allocated central service costs are usually negotiated and approved for a future fiscal year on a “fixed with carry-forward” basis. Under this procedure, the fixed amounts for the future year covered by agreement are not subject to adjustment for that year. However, when the actual costs of the year involved become known, the differences between the fixed amounts previously approved and the actual costs will be carried forward and used as an adjustment to the fixed amounts established for a later year. This “carry-forward” procedure applies to all central services whose costs were fixed in the approved plan. However, a carry-forward adjustment is not permitted, for a central service activity that was not included in the approved plan, or for unallowable costs that must be reimbursed immediately.
Billing rates used to charge Federal awards must be based on the estimated costs of providing the services, including an estimate of the allocable central service costs. A comparison of the revenue generated by each billed service (including total revenues whether or not billed or collected) to the actual allowable costs of the service will be made at least annually, and an adjustment will be made for the difference between the revenue and the allowable costs. These adjustments will be made through one of the following adjustment methods: (a) a cash refund including earned or imputed interest from the date of transfer and debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with applicable Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs regulations to the Federal Government for the Federal share of the adjustment, (b) credits to the amounts charged to the individual programs, (c) adjustments to future billing rates, or (d) adjustments to allocated central service costs. Adjustments to allocated central services will not be permitted where the total amount of the adjustment for a particular service (Federal share and non-Federal) share exceeds $500,000. Adjustment methods may include, at the option of the cognizant agency, earned or imputed interest from the date of expenditure and delinquent debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with applicable cognizant agency claims collection regulations.
All central service cost allocation plans and related documentation used as a basis for claiming costs under Federal awards must be retained for audit in accordance with the records retention requirements contained in subpart D of this part.


If a dispute arises in the negotiation of a plan between the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the governmental unit, the dispute must be resolved in accordance with the appeals procedures of the cognizant agency for indirect costs.
To the extent that problems are encountered among the Federal agencies or governmental units in connection with the negotiation and approval process, OMB will lend assistance, as required, to resolve such problems in a timely manner.

C. Policy
D. Submission, Documentation, and Approval of Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plans
E. Review of Implementation of Approved Plans
F. Unallowable Costs
Federally-financed programs administered by state public assistance agencies are funded predominately by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In support of its stewardship requirements, HHS has published requirements for the development, documentation, submission, negotiation, and approval of public assistance cost allocation plans in Subpart E of 45 CFR Part 95. All administrative costs (direct and indirect) are normally charged to Federal awards by implementing the public assistance cost allocation plan. This Appendix extends these requirements to all Federal awarding agencies whose programs are administered by a state public assistance agency. Major federally-financed programs typically administered by state public assistance agencies include: Temporary Aid to Needy Families (TANF), Medicaid, Food Stamps, Child Support Enforcement, Adoption Assistance and Foster Care, and Social Services Block Grant.
1.  means a state agency administering or supervising the administration of one or more public assistance programs operated by the state as identified in Subpart E of 45 CFR Part 95. For the purpose of this Appendix, these programs include all programs administered by the state public assistance agency.
State public assistance agency2.  means all costs incurred by, or allocable to, the state public assistance agency, except expenditures for financial assistance, medical contractor payments, food stamps, and payments for services and goods provided directly to program recipients.
State public assistance agency costsState public assistance agencies will develop, document and implement, and the Federal Government will review, negotiate, and approve, public assistance cost allocation plans in accordance with Subpart E of 45 CFR Part 95. The plan will include all programs administered by the state public assistance agency. Where a letter of approval or disapproval is transmitted to a state public assistance agency in accordance with Subpart E, the letter will apply to all Federal agencies and programs. The remaining sections of this Appendix (except for the requirement for certification) summarize the provisions of Subpart E of 45 CFR Part 95.
1. State public assistance agencies are required to promptly submit amendments to the cost allocation plan to HHS for review and approval.
2. Under the coordination process outlined in section E, affected Federal agencies will review all new plans and plan amendments and provide comments, as appropriate, to HHS. The effective date of the plan or plan amendment will be the first day of the calendar quarter following the event that required the amendment, unless another date is specifically approved by HHS. HHS, as the cognizant agency for indirect costs acting on behalf of all affected Federal agencies, will, as necessary, conduct negotiations with the state public assistance agency and will inform the state agency of the action taken on the plan or plan amendment.


1. Since public assistance cost allocation plans are of a narrative nature, the review during the plan approval process consists of evaluating the appropriateness of the proposed groupings of costs (cost centers) and the related allocation bases. As such, the Federal Government needs some assurance that the cost allocation plan has been implemented as approved. This is accomplished by reviews by the Federal awarding agencies, single audits, or audits conducted by the cognizant agency for indirect costs.
2. Where inappropriate charges affecting more than one Federal awarding agency are identified, the cognizant HHS cost negotiation office will be advised and will take the lead in resolving the issue(s) as provided for in Subpart E of 45 CFR Part 95.
3. If a dispute arises in the negotiation of a plan or from a disallowance involving two or more Federal awarding agencies, the dispute must be resolved in accordance with the appeals procedures set out in 45 CFR Part 16. Disputes involving only one Federal awarding agency will be resolved in accordance with the Federal awarding agency's appeal process.
4. To the extent that problems are encountered among the Federal awarding agencies or governmental units in connection with the negotiation and approval process, the Office of Management and Budget will lend assistance, as required, to resolve such problems in a timely manner.
Claims developed under approved cost allocation plans will be based on allowable costs as identified in this Part. Where unallowable costs have been claimed and reimbursed, they will be refunded to the program that reimbursed the unallowable cost using one of the following methods: (a) a cash refund, (b) offset to a subsequent claim, or (c) credits to the amounts charged to individual Federal awards. Cash refunds, offsets, and credits may include at the option of the cognizant agency for indirect cost, earned or imputed interest from the date of expenditure and delinquent debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with applicable cognizant agency for indirect cost claims collection regulations.

NAppendix VII to Part 200APPENDIX1Appendix VII to Part 200—States and Local Government and Indian Tribe Indirect Cost Proposals


Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 30207, Apr. 22, 2024.20240422195A. General
B. Definitions
C. Allocation of Indirect Costs and Determination of Indirect Cost Rates
D. Submission and Documentation of Proposals


Certificate of Indirect Costs
E. Negotiation and Approval of Rates
F. Other Policies
1. Indirect costs are those that have been incurred for common or joint purposes. These costs benefit more than one cost objective and cannot be readily identified with a particular final cost objective without effort disproportionate to the results achieved. After direct costs have been determined and assigned directly to Federal awards and other activities as appropriate, indirect costs are those remaining to be allocated to benefitted cost objectives. A cost may not be allocated to a Federal award as an indirect cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose, in like circumstances, has been assigned to a Federal award as a direct cost.
2. Indirect costs include (a) the indirect costs originating in each department or agency of the governmental unit carrying out Federal awards and (b) the costs of central governmental services distributed through the central service cost allocation plan (as described in Appendix V to this part) and not otherwise treated as direct costs.
3. Indirect costs are normally charged to Federal awards by the use of an indirect cost rate. A separate indirect cost rate(s) is usually necessary for each department or agency of the governmental unit claiming indirect costs under Federal awards. Guidelines and illustrations of indirect cost proposals are provided in a brochure published by the Department of Health and Human Services entitled “ A copy of this brochure may be obtained from HHS Cost Allocation Services or at their website.
A Guide for States and Local Government Agencies: Cost Principles and Procedures for Establishing Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Rates for Grants and Contracts with the Federal Government.”4. Because of the diverse characteristics and accounting practices of governmental units, the types of costs which may be classified as indirect costs cannot be specified in all situations. However, typical examples of indirect costs may include certain state/local-wide central service costs, general administration of the non-Federal entity accounting and personnel services performed within the non-Federal entity, depreciation on buildings and equipment, the costs of operating and maintaining facilities.
5. This Appendix does not apply to state public assistance agencies. These agencies should refer instead to Appendix VI to this part.


1.  means the accumulated direct costs (normally either total direct salaries and wages or total direct costs exclusive of any extraordinary or distorting expenditures) used to distribute indirect costs to individual Federal awards. The direct cost base selected should result in each Federal award bearing a fair share of the indirect costs in reasonable relation to the benefits received from the costs.
Base2.  for the allocation of indirect costs is the period in which such costs are incurred and accumulated for allocation to activities performed in that period. The base period normally should coincide with the governmental unit's fiscal year, but in any event, must be so selected as to avoid inequities in the allocation of costs.
Base period3.  means the Federal agency responsible for reviewing and approving the governmental unit's indirect cost rate(s) on the behalf of the Federal Government. The cognizant agency for indirect costs assignment is described in Appendix V, section F.
Cognizant agency for indirect costs4.  means an indirect cost rate applicable to a specified past period which is based on the actual allowable costs of the period. A final audited rate is not subject to adjustment.
Final rate5.  means an indirect cost rate which has the same characteristics as a predetermined rate, except that the difference between the estimated costs and the actual, allowable costs of the period covered by the rate is carried forward as an adjustment to the rate computation of a subsequent period.
Fixed rate6.  is the accumulated costs that jointly benefit two or more programs or other cost objectives.
Indirect cost pool7.  is a device for determining in a reasonable manner the proportion of indirect costs each program should bear. It is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the indirect costs to a direct cost base.
Indirect cost rate8.  means the documentation prepared by a governmental unit or subdivision thereof to substantiate its request for the establishment of an indirect cost rate.
Indirect cost rate proposal9.  means an indirect cost rate, applicable to a specified current or future period, usually the governmental unit's fiscal year. This rate is based on an estimate of the costs to be incurred during the period. Except under very unusual circumstances, a predetermined rate is not subject to adjustment. (Because of legal constraints, predetermined rates are not permitted for Federal contracts; they may, however, be used for grants or cooperative agreements.) Predetermined rates may not be used by governmental units that have not submitted and negotiated the rate with the cognizant agency for indirect costs. In view of the potential advantages offered by this procedure, negotiation of predetermined rates for indirect costs for a period of two to four years should be the norm in those situations where the cost experience and other pertinent facts available are deemed sufficient to enable the parties involved to reach an informed judgment as to the probable level of indirect costs during the ensuing accounting periods.
Predetermined rate10.  means a temporary indirect cost rate applicable to a specified period which is used for funding, interim reimbursement, and reporting indirect costs on Federal awards pending the establishment of a “final” rate for that period.


Provisional ratea. Where a governmental unit's department or agency has only one major function, or where all its major functions benefit from the indirect costs to approximately the same degree, the allocation of indirect costs and the computation of an indirect cost rate may be accomplished through simplified allocation procedures as described in subsection 2.
b. Where a governmental unit's department or agency has several major functions which benefit from its indirect costs in varying degrees, the allocation of indirect costs may require the accumulation of such costs into separate cost groupings which then are allocated individually to benefitted functions by means of a base which best measures the relative degree of benefit. The indirect costs allocated to each function are then distributed to individual Federal awards and other activities included in that function by means of an indirect cost rate(s).
c. Specific methods for allocating indirect costs and computing indirect cost rates along with the conditions under which each method should be used are described in subsections 2, 3 and 4.
a. Where a non-Federal entity's major functions benefit from its indirect costs to approximately the same degree, the allocation of indirect costs may be accomplished by (1) classifying the non-Federal entity's total costs for the base period as either direct or indirect, and (2) dividing the total allowable indirect costs (net of applicable credits) by an equitable distribution base. The result of this process is an indirect cost rate which is used to distribute indirect costs to individual Federal awards. The rate should be expressed as the percentage which the total amount of allowable indirect costs bears to the base selected. This method should also be used where a governmental unit's department or agency has only one major function encompassing a number of individual projects or activities, and may be used where the level of Federal awards to that department or agency is relatively small.
b. Both the direct costs and the indirect costs must exclude capital expenditures and unallowable costs. However, unallowable costs must be included in the direct costs if they represent activities to which indirect costs are properly allocable.
c. The distribution base may be (1) total direct costs (excluding capital expenditures and other distorting items, such as pass-through funds, subcontracts in excess of $50,000, and participant support costs), (2) direct salaries and wages, or (3) another base which results in an equitable distribution.






a. Where a non-Federal entity's indirect costs benefit its major functions in varying degrees, such costs must be accumulated into separate cost groupings. Each grouping must then be allocated individually to benefitted functions by means of a base which best measures the relative benefits.
b. The cost groupings should be established so as to permit the allocation of each grouping on the basis of benefits provided to the major functions. Each grouping should constitute a pool of expenses that are of like character in terms of the functions they benefit and in terms of the allocation base which best measures the relative benefits provided to each function. The number of separate groupings should be held within practical limits, taking into consideration the materiality of the amounts involved and the degree of precision needed.
c. Actual conditions must be taken into account in selecting the base to be used in allocating the expenses in each grouping to benefitted functions. When an allocation can be made by assignment of a cost grouping directly to the function benefitted, the allocation must be made in that manner. When the expenses in a grouping are more general in nature, the allocation should be made through the use of a selected base which produces results that are equitable to both the Federal Government and the governmental unit. In general, any cost element or related factor associated with the governmental unit's activities is potentially adaptable for use as an allocation base provided that: (1) it can readily be expressed in terms of dollars or other quantitative measures (total direct costs, direct salaries and wages, staff hours applied, square feet used, hours of usage, number of documents processed, population served, and the like), and (2) it is common to the benefitted functions during the base period.
d. Except where a special indirect cost rate(s) is required in accordance with paragraph (C)(4) of this Appendix, the separate groupings of indirect costs allocated to each major function must be aggregated and treated as a common pool for that function. The costs in the common pool must then be distributed to individual Federal awards included in that function by use of a single indirect cost rate.


e. The distribution base used in computing the indirect cost rate for each function may be (1) total direct costs (excluding capital expenditures and other distorting items such as pass-through funds, subawards in excess of $50,000, and participant support costs), (2) direct salaries and wages, or (3) another base which results in an equitable distribution. An indirect cost rate should be developed for each separate indirect cost pool developed. The rate in each case should be stated as the percentage relationship between the particular indirect cost pool and the distribution base identified with that pool.










a. In some instances, a single indirect cost rate for all activities of a non-Federal entity or for each major function of the agency may not be appropriate. It may not take into account those different factors which may substantially affect the indirect costs applicable to a particular program or group of programs. The factors may include the physical location of the work, the level of administrative support required, the nature of the facilities or other resources employed, the organizational arrangements used, or any combination thereof. When a particular Federal award is carried out in an environment which appears to generate a significantly different level of indirect costs, provisions should be made for a separate indirect cost pool applicable to that Federal award. The separate indirect cost pool should be developed during the course of the regular allocation process, and the separate indirect cost rate resulting therefrom should be used, provided that: (1) The rate differs significantly from the rate which would have been developed under paragraphs (C)(2) and (C)(3) of this Appendix, and (2) the Federal award to which the rate would apply is material in amount.
b. Where Federal statutes restrict the reimbursement of certain indirect costs, it may be necessary to develop a special rate for the affected Federal award. Where a “restricted rate” is required, the same procedure for developing a non-restricted rate will be used except for the additional step of the elimination from the indirect cost pool those costs for which the law prohibits reimbursement.


a. All departments or agencies of the governmental unit desiring to claim indirect costs under Federal awards must prepare an indirect cost rate proposal and related documentation to support those costs. The proposal and related documentation must be retained for audit in accordance with the records retention requirements contained in § 200.334.
b. A governmental department or agency (such as a state or local Department of Health, Department of Transportation, or Department of Housing) that receives more than $35 million in direct Federal funding during its fiscal year must submit its indirect cost rate proposal to its cognizant agency for indirect costs.
c. If a governmental department or agency (such as a state or local Department of Health, Department of Transportation, or Department of Housing) receives $35 million or less in direct Federal funding during its fiscal year, it must develop an indirect cost proposal in accordance with the requirements of this part and maintain the proposal and related supporting documentation for audit. This established rate must be accepted by any Federal agency to which the governmental department or agency applies for funding. Federal agencies must not compel the governmental department or agency to accept the de minimis rate or some other rate established by the Federal agency. These governmental departments or agencies are not required to submit their proposals unless they are specifically requested to do so by an awarding Federal agency. The Federal agency's review should be limited to ensuring the proposal is consistent with the principles of this part. Where a non-Federal entity only receives funds as a subrecipient, the pass-through entity will be responsible for negotiating and/or monitoring the subrecipient's indirect costs.
c. Each Indian tribal government desiring reimbursement of indirect costs must submit its indirect cost proposal to the Department of the Interior (its cognizant agency for indirect costs).
d. Indirect cost proposals must be developed (and, when required, submitted) within six months after the close of the governmental unit's fiscal year, unless an exception is approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs. If the proposed central service cost allocation plan for the same period has not been approved by that time, the indirect cost proposal may be prepared including an amount for central services that is based on the latest federally approved central service cost allocation plan. The difference between these central service amounts and the amounts ultimately approved will be compensated for by an adjustment in a subsequent period.


The following must be included with each indirect cost proposal:
a. The rates proposed, including subsidiary work sheets and other relevant data, cross referenced and reconciled to the financial data noted in subsection b. Allocated central service costs will be supported by the summary table included in the approved central service cost allocation plan. This summary table is not required to be submitted with the indirect cost proposal if the central service cost allocation plan for the same fiscal year has been approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs and is available to the funding agency.
b. A copy of the financial data (financial statements, comprehensive annual financial report, executive budgets, accounting reports, etc.) upon which the rate is based. Adjustments resulting from the use of unaudited data will be recognized, where appropriate, by the Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs in a subsequent proposal.
c. The approximate amount of direct base costs incurred under Federal awards. These costs should be broken out between salaries and wages and other direct costs.
d. A chart showing the organizational structure of the agency during the period for which the proposal applies, along with a functional statement(s) noting the duties and/or responsibilities of all units that comprise the agency. (Once this is submitted, only revisions need be submitted with subsequent proposals.)
Each indirect cost rate proposal must be accompanied by a certification in the following form:
This is to certify that I have reviewed the indirect cost rate proposal submitted herewith and to the best of my knowledge and belief:
(1) All costs included in this proposal [identify date] to establish billing or final indirect costs rates for [identify period covered by rate] are allowable in accordance with the requirements of the Federal award(s) to which they apply and the provisions of this Part. Unallowable costs have been adjusted for in allocating costs as indicated in the indirect cost proposal
(2) All costs included in this proposal are properly allocable to Federal awards on the basis of a beneficial or causal relationship between the expenses incurred and the agreements to which they are allocated in accordance with applicable requirements. Further, the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs have not been claimed as direct costs. Similar types of costs have been accounted for consistently and the Federal Government will be notified of any accounting changes that would affect the predetermined rate.
1. Indirect cost rates will be reviewed, negotiated, and approved by the cognizant agency on a timely basis. Once a rate has been agreed upon, it will be accepted and used by all Federal agencies unless prohibited or limited by statute. Where a Federal awarding agency has reason to believe that special operating factors affecting its Federal awards necessitate special indirect cost rates, the funding agency will, prior to the time the rates are negotiated, notify the cognizant agency for indirect costs.
2. The use of predetermined rates, if allowed, is encouraged where the cognizant agency for indirect costs has reasonable assurance based on past experience and reliable projection of the non-Federal entity's costs, that the rate is not likely to exceed a rate based on actual costs. Long-term agreements utilizing predetermined rates extending over two or more years are encouraged, where appropriate.
3. The results of each negotiation must be formalized in a written agreement between the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the governmental unit. This agreement will be subject to re-opening if the agreement is subsequently found to violate a statute, or the information upon which the plan was negotiated is later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate. The agreed upon rates must be made available to all Federal agencies for their use.
4. Refunds must be made if proposals are later found to have included costs that (a) are unallowable (i) as specified by law or regulation, (ii) as identified in § 200.420, or (iii) by the terms and conditions of Federal awards, or (b) are unallowable because they are clearly not allocable to Federal awards. These adjustments or refunds will be made regardless of the type of rate negotiated (predetermined, final, fixed, or provisional).


If overall fringe benefit rates are not approved for the governmental unit as part of the central service cost allocation plan, these rates will be reviewed, negotiated and approved for individual recipient agencies during the indirect cost negotiation process. In these cases, a proposed fringe benefit rate computation should accompany the indirect cost proposal. If fringe benefit rates are not used at the recipient agency level (i.e., the agency specifically identifies fringe benefit costs to individual employees), the governmental unit should so advise the cognizant agency for indirect costs.
In some cases, governmental departments or agencies (components of the governmental unit) provide and bill for services similar to those covered by central service cost allocation plans (e.g., computer centers). Where this occurs, the governmental departments or agencies (components of the governmental unit)should be guided by the requirements in Appendix V relating to the development of billing rates and documentation requirements, and should advise the cognizant agency for indirect costs of any billed services. Reviews of these types of services (including reviews of costing/billing methodology, profits or losses, etc.) will be made on a case-by-case basis as warranted by the circumstances involved.
In certain situations, governmental departments or agencies (components of the governmental unit), because of the nature of their Federal awards, may be required to develop a cost allocation plan that distributes indirect (and, in some cases, direct) costs to the specific funding sources. In these cases, a narrative cost allocation methodology should be developed, documented, maintained for audit, or submitted, as appropriate, to the cognizant agency for indirect costs for review, negotiation, and approval.
If a dispute arises in a negotiation of an indirect cost rate (or other rate) between the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the governmental unit, the dispute must be resolved in accordance with the appeals procedures of the cognizant agency for indirect costs.
Costs specifically identified as unallowable and charged to Federal awards either directly or indirectly will be refunded (including interest chargeable in accordance with applicable Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs regulations).
To the extent that problems are encountered among the Federal agencies or governmental units in connection with the negotiation and approval process, OMB will lend assistance, as required, to resolve such problems in a timely manner.

ASUBPARTSubpart A—Application for Federal Assistance415.1SECTION1§ 415.1   Administrative standards for discretionary grants and cooperative agreements.(a) All USDA awarding agencies must demonstrate a commitment to encouraging free and open competition in all discretionary grant and cooperative agreement funding opportunities. USDA awarding agencies must ensure that all eligible applications for discretionary grants and cooperative agreements receive fair and impartial review, be evaluated only on criteria as stated in the respective notice of funding opportunity, and that no applicant receive an unfair advantage.
(b) USDA awarding agencies must enter into discretionary grants and cooperative agreements only after competition. Exceptions to this requirement may only be made by USDA awarding agencies where expressly provided by statute, when directed by Congress, where the requirement is determined to be inconsistent with international assistance objectives of USDA, or as specified in paragraph (d) of this section or as approved by the Secretary and OMB under paragraph (e). A USDA awarding agency's competitive award process must adhere to the following standards:
(1) All notices of funding opportunities for discretionary grants and cooperative agreements must be published on  as described in 2 CFR 200.204(a). When notices of funding opportunities contain an information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 ) or its implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 1320, USDA awarding agencies must seek and obtain OMB approval before collecting information from the public.
Grants.govet seq.(i) Supplementary to the requirements at paragraph (b)(1), USDA awarding agencies may make use of other methods of disseminating public information concerning notices of funding opportunities. In doing so, USDA awarding agencies must:
(A) Pursue the broadest dissemination of information concerning notices of funding opportunities in order to reach the greatest number and diversity of potential applicants.
(B) Avoid any appearance that an unfair advantage has been provided to any entity, inclusive of the memberships or networks of such entities, which may arise from the use of any dissemination method.
(C) Provide only public information concerning notices of funding opportunities.
(D) Seek the greatest cost savings to the Government, whenever possible.
(ii) Nothing in this part will be interpreted as to limit, impede, or otherwise prevent the attendance of any USDA awarding agency's staff, acting in their official capacity, at a conference, event, or similar activity, for the purposes of disseminating public information concerning notices of funding opportunities.
(2) Applications must be evaluated objectively by independent reviewers in accordance with evaluation criteria set forth in writing by the USDA awarding agency. USDA awarding agencies must establish written procedures to gain reasonable assurance that individuals selected to serve as independent reviewers are qualified to conduct any assigned review activity and that applications are scored by independent reviewers solely on the basis of criteria announced in the respective published notice of funding opportunity. Independent reviewers must make written comments or make a written determination of scoring, as appropriate, concerning each application to which they are assigned.
(i) Independent reviewers may be from the private or public sector, including another Federal agency, or within the awarding agency. Independent reviewers must not be any individual who holds or has been delegated approval or award authority for the applications being reviewed or components thereof.
(ii) Anyone who has or might appear to have a conflict of interest with any element of an application considered for selection or funding will be ineligible to serve as an independent reviewer. A conflict of interest might arise when the prospective independent reviewer, the reviewer's immediate family members, or the reviewer's partner, have been associated with the applicant or applicant organization within the past two years as an owner, partner, officer, director, employee, or consultant; has any financial or other interest in or tangible personal benefit from the applicant or applicant organizations; or is negotiating for, or has any arrangement, concerning prospective employment.
(3) Notwithstanding this paragraph (b), unless directed by Congress or authorized by statute, USDA awarding agencies may, but are not required to, review, evaluate for eligibility, or otherwise consider for funding any unsolicited application, proposal materials, ideas, pitches, or any other request for Federal funds provided by any entity for the purpose of obtaining Federal financial assistance.
(c) The final decision to award is at the discretion of the awarding official in each USDA awarding agency. The awarding official must consider the ranking, comments, and recommendations from the respective independent reviewers, and any other pertinent information before deciding which applications to approve and their order of approval. Any appeals by applicants regarding the awarding decision must be handled by the awarding agency using existing, written agency appeal procedures.
(d) The awarding official may make a determination that competition is not deemed appropriate for a particular transaction. Such determination must be made in writing on a case-by-case basis and be limited to transactions where it can be adequately justified that a noncompetitive award is in the best interest of the Government and necessary to the accomplishment of the goals of USDA. Reasons for considering noncompetitive awards are:
(1) Nonmonetary awards of property or services.
(2) Awards of less than $100,000.
(3) Awards to fund continuing work already started under a previous award for which competition for continued support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity or completion of the activity.
(4) Time constraints associated with a public health, safety, welfare, or national security requirement preclude competition.
(e) USDA awarding agencies may establish alternate exceptions from competition for discretionary awards. All such alternative exceptions will be subject to review and approval both by the Secretary and by OMB, pursuant to pursuant to 2 CFR 200.102, and 2 CFR 200.107 when applicable, and publicly set forth in writing by the USDA awarding agency.
(f) All actions taken USDA awarding agencies for the purpose of accomplishing any element of Federal financial assistance programs, awards, and any related or subsequent transactions, must comply with the direction set forth in Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Policy Letter 11-01 and successor policy regarding the performance of inherently governmental and critical functions.

(a) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered transaction if any of the following applies:
(1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement transaction covered under § 417.210, and the contract amount is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.
(2) [Reserved]
(b) Any procurement contract to be implemented outside the United States that is below the primary tier covered transaction in a USDA foreign assistance program is not a covered transaction, notwithstanding the provisions in 2 CFR 180.220(a) and 2 CFR 180.220(b) and paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) Any procurement contract to be implemented outside the United States that is below the primary tier covered transaction in a USDA export credit guarantee program or direct credit program is not a covered transaction, notwithstanding the provisions in 2 CFR 180.220(a) and 2 CFR 180.220(b) and paragraph (a) of this section.

SAM.govSAM.gov417.221SECTION1§ 417.221   How would the exclusions from coverage for the USDA's foreign assistance programs apply?The primary tier covered transaction would be the food aid grant agreement entered into between USDA and a program participant, such as a U.S. private voluntary organization. USDA would have to check  before entering into the food aid grant agreement to ensure that the U.S. private voluntary organization that would be the primary tier participant is not excluded or disqualified. A transaction at the first lower tier might be a subrecipient agreement between the U.S. private voluntary organization and a foreign subrecipient of the commodities that were provided under the food aid grant agreement. Pursuant to § 417.215(a)(8), this nonprocurement transaction would not be a covered transaction. In addition, a transaction at the first lower tier might be a procurement contract entered into between the U.S. private voluntary organization and a foreign entity to provide supplies or services that are expected to equal or exceed $25,000 in value and that are needed by such organization to implement activities under the food aid grant agreement. Pursuant to § 417.220(b), this procurement contract would not be a covered transaction. However, pursuant to §§ 417.215(b) and 417.220(d), the U.S. private voluntary organization would be prohibited from entering into, at the first lower tier, an agreement with a subrecipient or a procurement contract that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 with an entity that appears in  as excluded or disqualified.




SAM.govSAM.gov417.222SECTION1§ 417.222   How would the exclusions from coverage for the USDA's export credit guarantee and direct credit programs apply?(a)  In the case of the export credit guarantee program, the primary tier covered transaction would be the guarantee issued by the USDA to a U.S. exporter. The U.S. exporter usually assigns the guarantee to a U.S. financial institution, and this would create another primary tier covered transaction between USDA and the U.S. financial institution. USDA would have to check the  before issuing a guarantee or accepting a guarantee assignment to ensure that the U.S. exporter or financial institution that would be the primary tier participant is not excluded or disqualified. A transaction at the first lower tier under the export credit guarantee program might be a payment obligation of a foreign bank to the U.S. exporter to pay on behalf of the importer for the exported U.S. commodities that are covered by the guarantee. Similarly, a transaction at the first lower tier might be a payment obligation of a foreign bank under an instrument, such as a loan agreement or letter of credit, to the U.S. financial institution assigned the guarantee, which has paid the exporter for the exported U.S. commodities and, in so doing, issued a loan to the foreign bank, which the foreign bank is obligated to repay on deferred payment terms. Pursuant to § 417.215(a)(9), these nonprocurement transactions would not be covered transactions. In addition, a transaction at the first lower tier under the export credit guarantee program might be a procurement contract ( a contract for the purchase and sale of goods) that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 entered into between the U.S. exporter and the foreign importer for the U.S. commodities, the payment for which is covered by the guarantee. Pursuant to § 417.220(c), this procurement contract would not be a covered transaction. However, pursuant to §§ 417.215(b) and 417.220(d), the U.S. exporter or U.S. financial institution would be prohibited from entering into, at the first lower tier, an agreement with an importer (or intervening purchaser) or foreign bank or a procurement contract that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 with an entity that appears on the  as excluded or disqualified.
Export credit guarantee program.SAM.govi.e.,SAM.gov(b)  In the case of the direct credit program, the primary tier covered transaction would be the financing agreement between the USDA and the U.S. exporter. USDA purchases the exporter's account receivable in a particular transaction pursuant to the financing agreement. On occasion, such a transaction may contemplate a payment obligation of a U.S. or foreign bank to make the required payments. USDA would have to check  before entering into a financing agreement or accepting such a payor to ensure that the U.S. exporter or the bank, if any, that would be the primary tier participant is not excluded or disqualified. A transaction at the first lower tier might be a payment obligation of the importer to pay the exporter for the exported U.S. commodities that are covered by the financing agreement. Pursuant to § 417.215(a)(9), this nonprocurement transaction would not be a covered transaction. In addition, a transaction at the first lower tier might be a procurement contract that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 entered into between the U.S. exporter and the foreign importer for the U.S. commodities, the payment for which is covered by the financing agreement. Pursuant to § 417.220(c), this procurement contract would not be a covered transaction. However, pursuant to §§ 417.215(b) and 417.220(d), the U.S. exporter would be prohibited from entering into, at the first lower tier, an agreement with an importer (or intervening purchaser) or bank, or a procurement contract that is expected to equal or exceed $25,000 with an entity that appears in  as excluded or disqualified.

BSUBPARTSubpart B—Activities by Own Employees418.200SECTION1§ 418.200   Agency and legislative liaison.(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 418.100(a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not directly related to a covered Federal action.
(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable at any time.
(c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered Federal action:
(1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and,
(2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an agency's use.
(d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:
(1) Providing any information not specifically requested but necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of a covered Federal action;
(2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,
(3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended by Public Law 95-507 and other subsequent amendments.
(e) Only those activities expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.




418.205SECTION1§ 418.205   Professional and technical services.(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 418.100(a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.
(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” will be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.
(c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
(d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

(b) The reporting requirements in § 418.110(a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, will not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.
(c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” will be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

(d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
(e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.
(f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.


DSUBPARTSubpart D—Penalties and Enforcement418.400SECTION1§ 418.400   Penalties.(a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein will be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such expenditure.
(b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (in the OMB-approved format) to be filed or amended if required herein, will be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such failure.
(c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.
(d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency will consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.
(e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section will be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons will be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.
(f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.




418.405SECTION1§ 418.405   Penalty procedures.Agencies must impose and collect civil penalties pursuant to the provisions of the Program Fraud and Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C. 3803 (except subsection (c)), 3804 through 3808, and 3812, insofar as these provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements herein.

The Secretary must transmit a copy of each such written exemption to Congress immediately after making such a determination.
(b) The Department of Defense may issue supplemental regulations to implement paragraph (a) of this section.

This includes, but is not limited to, research in economics, education, linguistics, medicine, psychology, social sciences, statistics, and research involving human subjects or animals regardless of the funding mechanism used to support it.
Research. All organizations using Federal funds for research, including, for example, colleges and universities, Federally funded research and development centers, national user facilities, industrial laboratories, or other research institutes. Activities which meet this definition constitute research for purposes of this part, whether or not they are conducted or supported under a program which is considered “research” for other purposes. For example, some demonstration and service programs may include research/scientific activities.
Research institution. Fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results. Research misconduct does not include honest error or differences of opinion.
Research misconduct. The record of data or results that embody the facts resulting from scientific inquiry, and includes, but is not limited to, research proposals, research records (including data, notes, journals, laboratory records (both physical and electronic)), progress reports, abstracts, theses, oral presentations, internal reports, and journal articles.
Research record. United States Department of Agriculture.
USDA. The individual designated by the Office of the Under Secretary for Research, Education, and Economics (REE) who is responsible for:
USDA Research Integrity Officer (USDA RIO).(1) Overseeing USDA agency responses to allegations of research misconduct;
(2) Ensuring that agency research misconduct procedures are consistent with this part;
(3) Receiving and assigning allegations of research misconduct reported by the public;
(4) Developing Memoranda of Understanding with agencies that elect not to develop their own research misconduct procedures;
(5) Monitoring the progress of all research misconduct cases; and
(6) Serving as liaison with OIG to receive allegations of research misconduct when they are received via the OIG Hotline.




422.2SECTION1§ 422.2   Procedures.Research institutions that conduct extramural research funded by USDA must foster an atmosphere conducive to research integrity. They must develop or have procedures in place to respond to allegations of research misconduct that ensure:
(a) Appropriate separations of responsibility for inquiry, investigation, and adjudication;
(b) Objectivity;
(c) Due process;
(d) Whistleblower protection;
(e) Confidentiality—to the extent possible and consistent with a fair and thorough investigation and as allowed by law, knowledge about the identity of subjects and complainants is limited to those who need to know; and
(f) Timely resolution.




422.3SECTION1§ 422.3   Inquiry, investigation, and adjudication.A research institution that conducts extramural research funded by USDA bears primary responsibility for prevention and detection of research misconduct and for the inquiry, investigation, and adjudication of research misconduct allegations reported directly to it. The research institution must perform an inquiry in response to an allegation, and must follow the inquiry with an investigation if the inquiry determines that the allegation or apparent instance of research misconduct has substance. The responsibilities for adjudication must be separate from those for inquiry and investigation. In most instances, USDA will rely on a research institution conducting extramural research to promptly:
(a) Initiate an inquiry into any suspected or alleged research misconduct;
(b) Conduct a subsequent investigation, if warranted;
(c) Acquire, prepare, and maintain appropriate records of allegations of extramural research misconduct and all related inquiries, investigations, and findings; and
(d) Take action to ensure the following:
(1) The integrity of research;
(2) The rights and interests of the subject of the investigation and the public are protected;
(3) The observance of legal requirements or responsibilities including cooperation with criminal investigations; and
(4) Appropriate safeguards for subjects of allegations, as well as complainants (see § 422.6). These safeguards should include timely written notification of subjects regarding substantive allegations made against them; a description of all such allegations; reasonable access to the data and other evidence supporting the allegations; and the opportunity to respond to allegations, the supporting evidence and the proposed findings of research misconduct, if any.




422.4SECTION1§ 422.4   USDA Panel to determine appropriateness of research misconduct policy.Before USDA will rely on a research institution to conduct an inquiry, investigation, and adjudication of an allegation in accordance with this part, the research institution where the research misconduct is alleged must provide the ARIO its policies and procedures related to research misconduct at the institution. The research institution has the option of providing either a written copy of such policies and procedures or a website address where such policies and procedures can be accessed. The ARIO to whom the policies and procedures were made available must convene a panel comprised of the USDA RIO and ARIOs from the Forest Service, the Agricultural Research Service, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. The Panel will review the research institution's policies and procedures for compliance with the OSTP Policy and render a decision regarding the research institution's ability to adequately resolve research misconduct allegations. The ARIO will inform the research institution of the Panel's determination that its inquiry, investigation, and adjudication procedures are sufficient. If the Panel determines that the research institution does not have sufficient policies and procedures in place to conduct inquiry, investigation, and adjudication proceedings, or that the research institution is in any way unfit or unprepared to handle the inquiry, investigation, and adjudication in a prompt, unbiased, fair, and independent manner, the ARIO will inform the research institution in writing of the Panel's decision. An appropriate USDA agency, as determined by the Panel, will then conduct the inquiry, investigation, and adjudication of research misconduct in accordance with this part. If an allegation of research misconduct is made regarding extramural research conducted at a Federal research institution (whether USDA or not), it is presumed that the Federal research institution has research misconduct procedures consistent with the OSTP Policy. USDA reserves the right to convene the Panel to assess the sufficiency of a Federal agency's research misconduct procedures, should there be any question whether the agency's procedures will ensure a fair, unbiased, equitable, and independent inquiry, investigation, and adjudication process.




422.5SECTION1§ 422.5   Reservation of right to conduct subsequent inquiry, investigation, and adjudication.(a) USDA reserves the right to conduct its own inquiry, investigation, and adjudication into allegations of research misconduct at a research institution conducting extramural research subsequent to the proceedings of the research institution related to the same allegation. This may be necessary if the USDA RIO or ARIO believes, using sound discretion, that despite the Panel's finding that the research institution in question had appropriate and OSTP-compliant research misconduct procedures in place, the research institution conducting the extramural research at issue:
(1) Did not adhere to its own research misconduct procedures;
(2) Did not conduct research misconduct proceedings in a fair, unbiased, or independent manner; or
(3) Has not completed research misconduct inquiry, investigation, or adjudication in a timely manner.
(b) Additionally, USDA reserves the right to conduct its own inquiry, investigation, and adjudication into allegations of research misconduct at a research institution conducting extramural research subsequent to the proceedings of the research institution related to the same allegation for any other reason that the USDA RIO or ARIO considers it appropriate to conduct research misconduct proceedings in lieu of the research institution's conducting the extramural research at issue. This right is subject to paragraph (c) of this section.
(c) In cases where the USDA RIO or ARIO believes it is necessary for USDA to conduct its own inquiry, investigation, and adjudication subsequent to the proceedings of the research institution related to the same allegation, the USDA RIO or ARIO will reconvene the Panel, which will determine whether it is appropriate for the relevant USDA agency to conduct the research misconduct proceedings related to the allegation(s) of research misconduct. If the Panel determines that it is appropriate for a USDA agency to conduct the proceedings, the ARIO will immediately notify the research institution in question. The research institution must then promptly provide the relevant USDA agency with documentation of the research misconduct proceedings the research institution has conducted to that point, and the USDA agency will conduct research misconduct proceedings in accordance with the Agency research misconduct procedures.




422.6SECTION1§ 422.6   Notification of USDA of allegations of research misconduct.(a) Research institutions that conduct USDA-funded extramural research must promptly notify OIG and the USDA RIO of all allegations of research misconduct or violations of Federal criminal statutes involving USDA funds when the institution inquiry into the allegation warrants the institution moving on to an investigation.
(b) Individuals at research institutions who suspect research misconduct at the institution should report allegations in accordance with the institution's research misconduct policies and procedures. Anyone else who suspects that researchers or research institutions performing Federally funded research may have engaged in research misconduct is encouraged to make a formal allegation of research misconduct to OIG.
(1) OIG has established a hotline for USDA employees and the general public to report fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement in USDA programs including allegations of research misconduct. Complaints, which may be submitted anonymously, must be filed with the OIG by submitting a complaint via the hotline on OIG's public website, sending a fax, or writing a letter.
(i) The OIG hotline may be accessed at 
https://usdaoig.oversight.gov/hotline.(ii) Complainants who submit to the hotline on OIG's public website and who wish to provide additional documentation may fax them to (202) 690-2474.
(iii) Letters may be mailed to: United States Department of Agriculture, Office of Inspector General, P.O. Box 23399, Washington, DC 20026-3399.
(2) The USDA RIO may be reached at: USDA Research Integrity Officer, 214W Whitten Building, Washington, DC 20250. Telephone: (202) 690-0745. Email: 
researchintegrity@usda.gov.(c) To the extent known, the following details should be included in any formal allegation:
(1) The name of the research projects involved, the nature of the alleged misconduct, and the names of the individual or individuals alleged to be involved in the misconduct;
(2) The source or sources of funding for the research project or research projects involved in the alleged misconduct;
(3) Important dates;
(4) Any documentation that bears upon the allegation; and
(5) Any other potentially relevant information.
(d) Safeguards for complainants give individuals the confidence that they can bring allegations of research misconduct made in good faith to the attention of appropriate authorities or serve as complainants to an inquiry or an investigation without suffering retribution. Safeguards include protection against retaliation for complainants who make good faith allegations, fair and objective procedures for the examination and resolution of allegations of research misconduct, and diligence in protecting the positions and reputations of those persons who make allegations of research misconduct in good faith. The identity of complainants who wish to remain anonymous will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law or regulation.




422.7SECTION1§ 422.7   Notification of ARIO during an inquiry or investigation.(a) Research institutions that conduct USDA-funded extramural research must promptly notify the ARIO should the institution become aware during an inquiry or investigation that:
(1) Public health or safety is at risk;
(2) The resources, reputation, or other interests of USDA are in need of protection;
(3) Research activities should be suspended;
(4) Federal action may be needed to protect the interest of a subject of the investigation or of others potentially affected;
(5) A premature public disclosure of the inquiry into or investigation of the allegation may compromise the process;
(6) The scientific community or the public should be informed; or
(7) There is reasonable indication of possible violations of civil or criminal law.
(b) If research misconduct proceedings reveal behavior that may be criminal in nature at any point during the proceedings, the institution must promptly notify the ARIO.




422.8SECTION1§ 422.8   Communication of research misconduct policies and procedures.Institutions that conduct USDA-funded extramural research are to maintain and effectively communicate to their staff policies and procedures relating to research misconduct, including the guidelines in this part. The institution is to inform their researchers and staff members who conduct USDA-funded extramural research when and under what circumstances USDA is to be notified of allegations of research misconduct, and when and under what circumstances USDA is to be updated on research misconduct proceedings.




422.9SECTION1§ 422.9   Documents required.(a) A research institution that conducts USDA-funded extramural research must maintain the following documents related to an allegation of research misconduct at the research institution:
(1) A written statement describing the original allegation;
(2) A copy of the formal notification presented to the subject of the allegation;
(3) A written report describing the inquiry stage and its outcome including copies of all supporting documentation;
(4) A description of the methods and procedures used to gather and evaluate information pertinent to the alleged misconduct during inquiry and investigation stages;
(5) A written report of the investigation, including the evidentiary record and supporting documentation;
(6) A written statement of the findings; and
(7) If applicable, a statement of recommended corrective actions, and any response to such a statement by the subject of the original allegation, and/or other interested parties, including any corrective action plan.
(b) The research institution must retain the documents specified in paragraph (a) of this section for at least 3 years following the final adjudication of the alleged research misconduct.




422.10SECTION1§ 422.10   Reporting to USDA.Following completion of an investigation into allegations of research misconduct, the institution conducting extramural research must provide to the ARIO a copy of the evidentiary record, the report of the investigation, recommendations made to the institution's adjudicating official, the adjudicating official's determination, the institution's corrective action taken or planned, and the written response of the individual who is the subject of the allegation to any recommendations.




422.11SECTION1§ 422.11   Research records and evidence.(a) A research institution that conducts extramural research supported by USDA funds, as the responsible legal entity for the USDA-supported research, has a continuing obligation to create and maintain adequate records (including documents and other evidentiary matter) as may be required by any subsequent inquiry, investigation, finding, adjudication, or other proceeding.
(b) Whenever an investigation is initiated, the research institution must promptly take all reasonable and practical steps to obtain custody of all relevant research records and evidence as may be necessary to conduct the research misconduct proceedings. This must be accomplished before the research institution notifies the researcher/respondent of the allegation, or immediately thereafter.
(c) The original research records and evidence taken into custody by the research institution must be inventoried and stored in a secure place and manner. Research records involving raw data must include the devices or instruments on which they reside. However, if deemed appropriate by the research institution or investigator, research data or records that reside on or in instruments or devices may be copied and removed from those instruments or devices as long as the copies are complete, accurate, and have substantially equivalent evidentiary value as the data or records have when the data or records reside on the instruments or devices. Such copies of data or records must be made by a disinterested, qualified technician and not by the subject of the original allegation or other interested parties. When the relevant data or records have been removed from the devices or instruments, the instruments or devices need not be maintained as evidence.




422.12SECTION1§ 422.12   Remedies for noncompliance.USDA agencies' implementation procedures identify the administrative actions available to remedy a finding of research misconduct. Such actions may include the recovery of funds, correction of the research record, debarment of the researcher(s) that engaged in the research misconduct, proper attribution, or any other action deemed appropriate to remedy the instance(s) of research misconduct. The agency should consider the seriousness of the misconduct, including, but not limited to, the degree to which the misconduct was knowingly conducted, intentional, or reckless; was an isolated event or part of a pattern; or had significant impact on the research record, research subjects, other researchers, institutions, or the public welfare. In determining the appropriate administrative action, the appropriate agency must impose a remedy that is commensurate with the infraction as described in the finding of research misconduct.




422.13SECTION1§ 422.13   Appeals.(a) If USDA relied on an institution to conduct an inquiry, investigation, and adjudication, the alleged person(s) should first follow the institution's appeal policy and procedures.
(b) USDA agencies' implementation procedures, which must be made available on a designated USDA public website, identify the appeal process when a finding of research misconduct is elevated to the agency.




422.14SECTION1§ 422.14   Relationship to other requirements.Some of the research covered by this part also may be subject to regulations of other governmental agencies ( a university that receives funding from a USDA agency and also under a grant from another Federal agency). If more than one agency of the Federal Government has jurisdiction, USDA will cooperate with the other agency(ies) in designating a lead agency. When USDA is not the lead agency, it will rely on the lead agency following its policies and procedures in determining whether there is a finding of research misconduct. Further, USDA may, in consultation with the lead agency, take action to protect the health and safety of the public, to promote the integrity of the USDA-supported research and research process, or to conserve public funds. When appropriate, USDA will seek to resolve allegations jointly with the other agency or agencies.

700.1SECTION1§ 700.1   Definitions.These are the definitions for terms used in this part. Different definitions may be found in Federal statutes or regulations that apply more specifically to particular programs or activities.
 means a person with the authority to enter into, administer, terminate, and closeout assistance agreements subject to this part, and make related determinations and findings on behalf of USAID. An Agreement Officer can only act within the scope of a duly authorized warrant or other valid delegation of authority. The term “Agreement Officer” includes persons warranted as “Grant Officers” and certain authorized representatives of the Agreement Officer acting within the limits of their authority as delegated by the Agreement Officer.
Agreement Officer means the applicant for USAID funding that the Agreement Officer recommends for an award after merit review, but who has not yet been awarded a grant, cooperative agreement or other assistance award. Apparently successful applicant status confers no right and constitutes no USAID commitment to an award, which still must be executed by the Agreement Officer.
An apparently successful applicant has the same meaning as  as defined in 2 CFR 200.1.
AwardFederal award mean any material, article, supply, goods or equipment, excluding recipient offices, vehicles, and non-deliverable items for recipient's internal use in administration of the USAID-funded grant, cooperative agreement, or other agreement or subaward.
Commodities means the date on which the recipient or subrecipient completes all work under an award or the date on the award document, or any supplement or amendment, on which USAID sponsorship ends.
End date means the organized set of activities directed toward a common purpose, objective, or goal that a recipient or subrecipient undertakes or proposes.
Program means an action by USAID that temporarily withdraws Federal sponsorship under an award, pending corrective action by the recipient or pending a decision to resume or terminate the award. Suspension of an award is a separate action from suspension under USAID regulations implementing E.O.s 12549 and 12689, “Debarment and Suspension.” See 2 CFR part 780.
Suspension means the United States Agency for International Development.

This part satisfies the requirements of 2 CFR 200.110(a) and gives regulatory effect to the OMB guidance as supplemented by this part.




700.3SECTION1§ 700.3   Applicability.(a) Subparts A through D of 2 CFR part 200 apply to for-profit entities located in the United States or its territories. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 30, Cost Accounting Standards, and Part 31, Contract Cost Principles and Procedures, takes precedence over the cost principles in Subpart E for Federal awards to U.S. for-profit entities.
(b) Subpart E applies to foreign organizations and foreign public entities, except where the Federal agency determines that the application of these subparts would be inconsistent with the international responsibilities of the United States or the laws of a foreign government. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 30, Cost Accounting Standards, and Part 31, Contract Cost Principles and Procedures, takes precedence over the cost principles in Subpart E for Federal awards to foreign for-profit entities.




700.4SECTION1§ 700.4   Exceptions.Consistent with 2 CFR 200.102:
(a) USAID's Assistant Administrator, Bureau for Management, or designee as delegated in Agency policy, may authorize exceptions on a case-by-case basis for individual federal awards, recipients, or subrecipients except where otherwise required by law or where OMB or other approval is expressly required by this Part. No case-by-case exceptions may be granted to the provisions of Subpart F—Audit Requirements of this Part.
(b) USAID's Assistant Administrator, Bureau for Management, or designee as delegated in Agency policy, may authorize exceptions, on a class or an individual case basis, to USAID program specific assistance regulations other than those which implement statutory and executive order requirements.
(c) The Federal agency may apply more restrictive requirements to a class of Federal awards or non-Federal entities when approved by OMB, required by Federal statutes, or regulations except for the requirements in Subpart F—Audit Requirements of this part. The Federal agency may apply less restrictive requirements when making awards at or below the simplified acquisition threshold, or when making fixed amount awards as defined in Subpart A—Acronyms and Definitions of 2 CFR part 200, except for those requirements imposed by statute or in Subpart F—Audit Requirements of this part.




700.5SECTION1§ 700.5   Supersession.Effective December 26, 2014, this part supersedes the following regulations under  22 CFR part 226, “Administration of Assistance Awards To U.S. Non-Governmental Organizations.”

(b) [Reserved]




700.14SECTION1§ 700.14   Award Suspension and Termination.If at any time USAID determines that continuation of all or part of the funding for a program should be suspended or terminated because such assistance would not be in the national interest of the United States or would be in violation of an applicable law, then USAID may, following notice to the recipient, suspend or terminate the award in whole or in part and prohibit the recipient from incurring additional obligations chargeable to the award other than those costs specified in the notice of suspension.

ESUBPARTSubpart E—Cost Principles [Reserved]FSUBPARTSubpart F—Audit Requirements [Reserved]GSUBPARTSubpart G—USAID-Specific Requirements700.16SECTION1§ 700.16   Marking.(a)  For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
Definitions.(1)  means a set of a recipient or subrecipient's actions using resources—such as commodities, technical assistance, or training to produce specific results, such as vaccinations given, schools built, microenterprise loans issued, or policies changed. The recipient or subrecipient undertakes activities to achieve the formally approved objectives of the award.
Activity(2)  means a strategy the apparently successful applicant or recipient submits describing how they will name and position the program, project, or activity and how they will promote and communicate it to beneficiaries and cooperating country citizens. In the branding strategy, the apparently successful applicant or recipient identifies all donors and explains how they will be acknowledged.
Branding strategy(3)  means a plan that the apparently successful applicant or recipient submits after merit review of an application for USAID funding, detailing the public communications, commodities, and program materials and other items that will visibly bear the USAID Identity.
Marking plan(4)  are documents and messages the recipient or subrecipient intends to distribute to external audiences. They include, but are not limited to, correspondence, publications, studies, reports, audio-visual productions, and other informational products; applications, forms, press and promotional materials used in connection with USAID-funded programs, projects or activities, including signage and plaques; websites/internet activities; and events such as training courses, conferences, seminars, and press conferences.
Public communications(5)  (Identity) means the official marking for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) comprised of the USAID logo or seal and new brandmark with the tagline that clearly communicates our assistance is “from the American people.” Upon a written determination by the USAID Administrator, or delegate, the definition of the USAID Identity may be amended to include additional or substitute use of a logo or seal and tagline representing a presidential initiative or other high level interagency Federal initiative that requires consistent and uniform branding and marking by all participating agencies. The USAID Identity (including any required additional insignia or related identity) is available on the USAID website at  and is provided without royalty, license or other fee to recipients of USAID funded grants or cooperative agreements or other assistance awards.
USAID Identityhttps://www.usaid.gov/branding(6)  means the most senior officer in an USAID Operating Unit in the field, for example, a USAID Mission Director or USAID Representative. For global programs managed from Washington but executed across many countries, such as disaster relief programs and assistance to internally displaced persons, humanitarian emergencies or immediate post conflict and political crisis responses, the cognizant Principal Officer may be an Office Director, for example, the Directors of USAID/W/Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance and Office of Transition Initiatives. For non-presence countries, the cognizant Principal Officer is the Senior USAID officer in a regional USAID Operating Unit responsible for the non-presence country, or in the absence of such a responsible operating unit, the Principal U.S Diplomatic Officer in the non-presence country exercising delegated authority from USAID.
Principal officer(b) USAID policy is that a recipient or subrecipient must mark all programs, projects, activities, public communications, and commodities, specified further at paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section, partially or fully funded by a USAID grant or cooperative agreement or other assistance award or subaward with the USAID Identity, of a size and prominence equivalent to or greater than the recipient's, other donor's or any other third party's identity or logo.
(1) USAID reserves the right to require the USAID Identity to be larger and more prominent if it is the majority donor, or to require that a cooperating country government's identity be larger and more prominent if circumstances warrant; any such requirement will be on a case-by-case basis depending on the audience, program goals and materials produced.
(2) USAID reserves the right to request pre-production review of USAID funded public communications and program materials for compliance with the approved Marking Plan.
(3) USAID reserves the right to require marking with the USAID Identity in the event the recipient does not choose to mark with its own identity or logo.
(4) Recipients of USAID funded grants and cooperative agreements or other assistance awards must include a USAID-approved marking provision in any USAID funded subaward, to read as follows:
(c) Subject to § 700.16(b), (i), and (k), the recipient or subrecipient must mark program, project, or activity sites funded by USAID, including visible infrastructure projects (for example, roads, bridges, buildings) or other programs, projects, or activities that are physical in nature (for example, agriculture, forestry, water management), with the USAID Identity. The recipient or subrecipient should erect temporary signs or plaques early in the construction or implementation phase. When construction or implementation is complete, the recipient or subrecipient must install a permanent, durable sign, plaque or other marking.
(d) Subject to § 700.16(b), (i), and (k), the recipient or subrecipient must mark technical assistance, studies, reports, papers, publications, audio-visual productions, public service announcements, websites/internet activities and other promotional, informational, media, or communications products funded by USAID with the USAID Identity.
(1) Any “public communications” as defined in § 700.1, funded by USAID, in which the content has not been approved by USAID, must contain the following disclaimer:
(2) The recipient must provide the Agreement Officer's Representative (AOR) or other USAID personnel designated in the grant or cooperative agreement with at least two copies of all program and communications materials produced under the award. In addition, the recipient must submit one electronic and/or one hard copy of all final documents to USAID's Development Experience Clearinghouse.
(e) Subject to § 700.16(b), (i), and (k), the recipient or subrecipient must mark events financed by USAID such as training courses, conferences, seminars, exhibitions, fairs, workshops, press conferences and other public activities, with the USAID Identity. Unless directly prohibited and as appropriate to the surroundings, recipients should display additional materials such as signs and banners with the USAID Identity. In circumstances in which the USAID Identity cannot be displayed visually, recipients should otherwise acknowledge USAID and the American people's support.
(f) Subject to § 700.16(b), (i), and (k), the recipient or subrecipient must mark all commodities financed by USAID, including commodities or equipment provided under humanitarian assistance or disaster relief programs, and all other equipment, supplies and other materials funded by USAID, and their export packaging, with the USAID Identity.
(g) After merit review of applications for USAID funding, USAID Agreement Officers will request apparently successful applicants to submit a Branding Strategy, defined in § 700.1. The proposed Branding Strategy will not be evaluated competitively. The Agreement Officer will review the proposed Branding Strategy for adequacy, and will negotiate, approve and include the Branding Strategy in the award. The Agreement Officer will specify the timeline for submission in the Notice of Funding Opportunity. If the Notice of Funding Opportunity indicates that the apparently successful applicant may submit a Branding Strategy after the award is made, the Agreement Officer must include a special award condition to indicate the required submission date. If the Agreement Officer requires submission before award, failure to submit or negotiate a Branding Strategy within the time specified by the Agreement Officer will make the apparently successful applicant ineligible for award.
(h) After merit review of applications for USAID funding, USAID Agreement Officers will request apparently successful applicants to submit a Marking Plan, defined in § 700.1. The Marking Plan may include requests for approval of Presumptive Exceptions, paragraph (i) of this section. The apparently successful applicant must include all estimated costs associated with branding and marking USAID programs, such as plaques, labels, banners, press events, promotional materials, and the like, in the total cost estimate of the grant or cooperative agreement or other assistance award. These costs are subject to revision and negotiation with the Agreement Officer upon submission of the Marking Plan. The Marking Plan will not be evaluated competitively. The Agreement Officer will review the proposed Marking Plan for adequacy, and will negotiate, approve and include the Marking Plan in the award. The Agreement Officer will specify the timeline for submission in the Notice of Funding Opportunity. If the Notice of Funding Opportunity indicates that the apparently successful applicant may submit a Marking Plan after the award is made, the Agreement Officer must include a special award condition to indicate the required submission date. If the Agreement Officer requires submission before award, failure to submit or negotiate a Marking Plan within the time specified by the Agreement Officer will make the apparently successful applicant ineligible for award. Agreement Officers have the discretion to suspend the implementation requirements of the Marking Plan if circumstances warrant. Recipients of a USAID funded grant or cooperative agreement or other assistance award or subaward should retain copies of any specific marking instructions or waivers in their project, program or activity files.
(i) Presumptive exceptions:
(1) The above marking requirements in § 700.16(b) through (f) may not apply if marking would:
(i) Compromise the intrinsic independence or neutrality of a program or materials where independence or neutrality is an inherent aspect of the program and materials, such as election monitoring or ballots, and voter information literature; political party support or public policy advocacy or reform; independent media, such as television and radio broadcasts, newspaper articles and editorials; public service announcements or public opinion polls and surveys.
(ii) Diminish the credibility of audits, reports, analyses, studies, or policy recommendations whose data or findings must be seen as independent.
(iii) Undercut host-country government “ownership” of constitutions, laws, regulations, policies, studies, assessments, reports, publications, surveys or audits, public service announcements, or other communications better positioned as “by” or “from” a cooperating country ministry or government official.
(iv) Impair the functionality of an item, such as sterilized equipment or spare parts.
(v) Incur substantial costs or be impractical, such as items too small or other otherwise unsuited for individual marking, such as food in bulk.
(vi) Offend local cultural or social norms, or be considered inappropriate on such items as condoms, toilets, bed pans, or similar commodities.
(vii) Conflict with international law.
(2) The Agreement Officer must approve these exceptions. Apparently successful applicants may request approval of one or more of the presumptive exceptions, depending on the circumstances, in their Marking Plan. The Agreement Officer will review requests for presumptive exceptions for adequacy, along with the rest of the Marking Plan. When reviewing a request for approval of a presumptive exception, the Agreement Officer may review how program materials will be marked (if at all) if the USAID identity is removed. Exceptions approved will apply to subrecipients unless otherwise provided by USAID.
(j) In cases where the recipient does not comply with the Marking Plan, the Agreement Officer will initiate corrective action. Such action may involve informing the recipient of a USAID grant or cooperative agreement or other assistance award or subaward of instances of noncompliance and requesting that the recipient carry out its responsibilities as set forth in the Marking Plan and award. Major or repeated non compliance with the Marking Plan will be governed by the uniform suspension and termination procedures set forth at 2 CFR 200.340 through 2 CFR 200.343, and 2 CFR 700.14.
(k)(1)  USAID Principal Officers may at any time after award waive in whole or in part the USAID approved Marking Plan, including USAID marking requirements for each USAID funded program, project, activity, public communication or commodity, or in exceptional circumstances may make a waiver by region or country, if the Principal Officer determines that otherwise USAID required marking would pose compelling political, safety, or security concerns, or marking would have an adverse impact in the cooperating country. USAID recipients may request waivers of the Marking Plan in whole or in part, through the AOR. No marking is required while a waiver determination is pending. The Principal Officer must make the waiver determination on safety or security grounds in consultation with U.S. Government security personnel if available, and must consider the same information that applies to determinations of the safety and security of U.S. Government employees in the cooperating country, as well as any information supplied by the AOR or the recipient for whom the waiver is sought. When reviewing a request for approval of a waiver, the Principal Officer may review how program materials will be marked (if at all) if the USAID Identity is removed. Approved waivers are not limited in duration but are subject to Principal Officer review at any time due to changed circumstances. Approved waivers “flow down” to recipients of subawards unless specified otherwise. Principal Officers may also authorize the removal of USAID markings already affixed if circumstances warrant. Principal Officers' determinations regarding waiver requests are subject to appeal to the Principal Officer's cognizant Assistant Administrator. Recipients may appeal by submitting a written request to reconsider the Principal Officer's waiver determination to the cognizant Assistant Administrator.
Waivers.(2)  Marking requirements apply to any obligation of USAID funds for new awards as of January 2, 2006. Marking requirements also will apply to new obligations under existing awards, such as incremental funding actions, as of January 2, 2006, when the total estimated cost of the existing award has been increased by USAID or the scope of effort is changed to accommodate any costs associated with marking. In the event a waiver is rescinded, the marking requirements will apply from the date forward that the waiver is rescinded. In the event a waiver is rescinded after the period of performance but before closeout as defined in 2 CFR 200.1, the USAID mission or operating unit with initial responsibility to administer the marking requirements must make a cost benefit analysis as to requiring USAID marking requirements after the end date of the affected programs, projects, activities, public communications or commodities.
Non-retroactivity.(l) USAID will provide the USAID Identity and other guidance at no cost or fee to recipients of USAID grants, cooperative agreements or other assistance awards or subawards. USAID will fund additional costs associated with marking requirements if reasonable, allowable, and allocable under 2 CFR part 200, subpart E. Recipients must follow the standard cost reimbursement provisions of the grant, cooperative agreement, other assistance award or subaward when applying for reimbursement of additional marking costs.






As a condition of receipt of this subaward, marking with the USAID Identity of a size and prominence equivalent to or greater than the recipient's, subrecipient's, other donor's or third party's is required. In the event the recipient chooses not to require marking with its own identity or logo by the subrecipient, USAID may, at its discretion, require marking by the subrecipient with the USAID Identity.This study/report/audio/visual/other information/media product (specify) is made possible by the generous support of the American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

Key personnel, whether or not they are employees of the prime recipient, must be vetted.
Key individual means those individuals identified for approval as part of substantial involvement in a cooperative agreement whose positions are essential to the successful implementation of an award.  means the USAID employee identified in the application or award as having responsibility for receiving vetting information, responding to questions about information to be included on the Partner Information Form, coordinating with the USAID Office of Security (SEC), and conveying the vetting determination to each applicant, potential subrecipients and contractors subject to vetting, and the agreement officer. The vetting official is not part of the office making the award selection and has no involvement in the selection process.


Key personnelVetting official701.2SECTION1§ 701.2   Applicability.The requirements established in this part apply to non-Federal entities, non-profit organizations, for-profit entities, and foreign organizations.


701.3SECTION1§ 701.3   Partner vetting.(a) It is USAID policy that USAID may determine that a particular award is subject to vetting in the interest of national security. In that case, USAID may require vetting of the key individuals of applicants, including key personnel, whether or not they are employees of the applicant, first tier subrecipients, contractors, and any other class of subawards and procurements as identified in the assistance solicitation and resulting award. When USAID conducts partner vetting, it will not award to any applicant who determined ineligible by the vetting process.
(b) When USAID determines an award to be subject to vetting, the agreement officer determines the appropriate stage of the award cycle to require applicants to submit the completed USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500-13, to the vetting official identified in the assistance solicitation. The agreement officer must specify in the assistance solicitation the stage at which the applicants will be required to submit the USAID Partner Information Form, USAID Form 500-13. As a general matter those applicants who will be vetted will be typically the applicants that have been determined to be apparently successful.
(c) Selection of the successful applicant proceeds separately from vetting. The agreement officer makes the selection determination separately from the vetting process and without knowledge of vetting-related information other than that, based on the vetting results, the apparently successful applicant is eligible or ineligible for an award. However, no applicants will be excluded from an award until after vetting has been completed.
(d) For those awards the agency has determined are subject to vetting, the agreement officer may only award to an applicant that has been determined to be eligible after completion of the vetting process.
(e)(1) For those awards the agency has determined are subject to vetting, the recipient must submit the completed USAID Partner Information Form any time it changes:
(i) Key individuals; or
(ii) Subrecipients and contractors for which vetting is required.
(2) The recipient must submit the completed Partner Information Form within 15 days of the change in either paragraph (e)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.
(f) USAID may vet key individuals of the recipient, subrecipients and contractors periodically during program implementation using information already submitted on the Form.
(g) When the prime recipient is subject to vetting, vetting may be required for key individuals of subawards when the prime recipient requests prior approval in accordance with 2 CFR 200.308(c)(6) for the subaward, transfer, or contracting out of any work.
(h) When the prime recipient is subject to vetting, vetting may be required for key individuals of contractors of certain services. The agreement officer must identify these services in the assistance solicitation and any resulting award.
(i) When vetting of subawards is required, the agreement officer must not approve the subaward, transfer, or contracting out, or the procurement of certain classes of items until the organization subject to vetting has been determined eligible. When vetting of contractors is required, the recipient may not procure the identified services until the contractor has been determined to be eligible.
(j) The recipient may instruct prospective subrecipients or, when applicable contractors who are subject to vetting to submit the USAID Partner Information Form to the vetting official as soon as the recipient submits the USAID Partner Information Form for its key individuals.
(k)  (1) The agreement officer must insert the pre-award provision Partner Vetting Pre-Award Requirements in Appendix B of this part in all assistance solicitations USAID identifies as subject to vetting.

(2) The vetting official will include information that USAID determines releasable. USAID will determine what information may be released consistent with applicable law and Executive Orders, and with the concurrence of relevant agencies.
(e) The inability to be deemed eligible as described in this award term may be determined to be a material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the award and may subject the recipient to suspension or termination as specified in the subpart “Remedies for Noncompliance” at 2 CFR part 200.
(f) Reconsideration: (1) Within 7 calendar days after the date of the vetting official's notification, the recipient or prospective subrecipient or contractor that has not passed vetting may request in writing to the vetting official that the Agency reconsider the vetting determination. The request should include any written explanation, legal documentation and any other relevant written material for reconsideration.
(2) Within 7 calendar days after the vetting official receives the request for reconsideration, the Agency will determine whether the recipient's additional information merits a revised decision.
(3) The Agency's determination of whether reconsideration is warranted is final.

In each case, even if the offense or violation is of a criminal, fraudulent or other serious nature, the decision to order a limited denial of participation shall be discretionary and in the best interests of the Government.


801.1105SECTION1§ 801.1105   Cause for a limited denial of participation.(a)  A limited denial of participation shall be based upon adequate evidence of any of the following causes:
Causes.(1) Irregularities in a participant's or contractor's performance in the VA loan guaranty program;
(2) Denial of participation in programs administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development or the Department of Agriculture, Rural Housing Service;
(3) Failure to satisfy contractual obligations or to proceed in accordance with contract specifications;
(4) Failure to proceed in accordance with VA requirements or to comply with VA regulations;
(5) Construction deficiencies deemed by VA to be the participant's responsibility;
(6) Falsely certifying in connection with any VA program, whether or not the certification was made directly to VA;
(7) Commission of an offense or other cause listed in § 180.800;
(8) Violation of any law, regulation, or procedure relating to the application for guaranty, or to the performance of the obligations incurred pursuant to a commitment to guaranty;
(9) Making or procuring to be made any false statement for the purpose of influencing in any way an action of the Department.

(b)  A criminal indictment or information shall constitute adequate evidence for the purpose of limited denial of participation actions.
Indictment.(c)  Imposition of a limited denial of participation by a VA field facility shall, at the discretion of any other VA field facility, constitute adequate evidence for a concurrent limited denial of participation. Where such a concurrent limited denial of participation is imposed, participation may be restricted on the same basis without the need for an additional conference or further hearing.


Limited denial of participation.801.1110SECTION1§ 801.1110   Scope and period of a limited denial of participation.(a)  The scope of a limited denial of participation shall be as follows:
Scope and period.(1) A limited denial of participation extends only to participation in the VA Loan Guaranty Program and shall be effective only within the geographic jurisdiction of the office or offices imposing it.
(2) The sanction may be imposed for a period not to exceed 12 months except for unresolved construction deficiencies. In cases involving construction deficiencies, the builder may be excluded for either a period not to exceed 12 months or for an indeterminate period which ends when the deficiency has been corrected or otherwise resolved in a manner acceptable to VA.
(b)  The sanction shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall remain effective for the prescribed period. If the cause for the limited denial of participation is resolved before the expiration of the prescribed period, the official who imposed the sanction may terminate it. The imposition of a limited denial of participation shall not affect the right of the Department to suspend or debar any person under this part.
Effectiveness.(c)  An affiliate or organizational element may be included in a limited denial of participation solely on the basis of its affiliation, and regardless of its knowledge of or participation in the acts providing cause for the sanction. The burden of proving that a particular affiliate or organizational element is capable of meeting VA requirements and is currently a responsible entity and not controlled by the primary sanctioned party (or by an entity that itself is controlled by the primary sanctioned party) is on the affiliate or organizational element.


Affiliates.801.1111SECTION1§ 801.1111   Notice.(a)  A limited denial of participation shall be initiated by advising a participant or contractor, and any specifically named affiliate, by certified mail, return receipt requested:
Generally.(1) That the sanction is effective as of the date of the notice;
(2) Of the reasons for the sanction in terms sufficient to put the participant or contractor on notice of the conduct or transaction(s) upon which it is based;
(3) Of the cause(s) relied upon under § 801.1105 for imposing the sanction;
(4) Of the right to request in writing, within 30 days of receipt of the notice, a conference on the sanction, and the right to have such conference held within 10 business days of receipt of the request;
(5) Of the potential effect of the sanction and the impact on the participant's or contractor's participation in Departmental programs, specifying the program(s) involved and the geographical area affected by the action.
(b)  After 30 days, if no conference has been requested, the official imposing the limited denial of participation will notify VA Central Office of the action taken and of the fact that no conference has been requested. If a conference is requested within the 30-day period, VA Central Office need not be notified unless a decision to affirm all or a portion of the remaining period of exclusion is issued. VA Central Office will notify all VA field offices of sanctions imposed and still in effect under this subpart.


Notification of action.801.1112SECTION1§ 801.1112   Conference.Upon receipt of a request for a conference, the official imposing the sanction shall arrange such a conference with the participant or contractor and may designate another official to conduct the conference. The participant shall be given the opportunity to be heard within 10 business days of receipt of the request. This conference precedes, and is in addition to, the formal hearing provided if an appeal is taken under § 801.1113. Although formal rules of procedure do not apply to the conference, the participant or contractor may be represented by counsel and may present all relevant information and materials to the official or designee. After consideration of the information and materials presented, the official shall, in writing, advise the participant or contractor of the decision to withdraw, modify or affirm the limited denial of participation. If the decision is made to affirm all or a portion of the remaining period of exclusion, the participant shall be advised of the right to request a formal hearing in writing within 30 days of receipt of the notice of decision. This decision shall be issued promptly, but in no event later than 20 days after the conference and receipt of materials.


801.1113SECTION1§ 801.1113   Appeal.Where the decision is made to affirm all or a portion of the remaining period of exclusion, any participant desiring an appeal shall file a written request for a hearing with the Under Secretary for Benefits, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420. This request shall be filed within 30 days of receipt of the decision to affirm. If a hearing is requested, it shall be held in accordance with the procedures in §§ 108.825 through 108.855. Where a limited denial of participation is followed by a suspension or debarment, the limited denial of participation shall be superseded and the appeal shall be heard solely as an appeal of the suspension or debarment.

However, the recipient's good faith administration of this section and the effectiveness of its remedial actions and sanctions shall be positive considerations and shall be taken into account as mitigating factors in assessing the need for such actions. If DOE pursues any such action, it will inform the subject of the action of the outcome and any applicable appeal procedures.
(f) In conducting the activities in paragraph (c) of this section, the recipient and DOE, if it elects to conduct the inquiry or investigation, shall adhere to the following guidelines:
(1)  The recipient shall provide safeguards to ensure that individuals may bring allegations of research misconduct made in good faith to the attention of the recipient without suffering retribution. Safeguards include: Protection against retaliation; fair and objective procedures for examining and resolving allegations; and diligence in protecting positions and reputations. The recipient shall also provide the subjects of allegations confidence that their rights are protected and that the mere filing of an allegation of research misconduct will not result in an adverse action. Safeguards include timely written notice regarding substantive allegations against them, a description of the allegation and reasonable access to any evidence submitted to support the allegation or developed in response to an allegation and notice of any findings of research misconduct.
Safeguards for information and subjects of allegations.(2)  The recipient shall select individual(s) to inquire, investigate, and adjudicate allegations of research misconduct who have appropriate expertise and have no unresolved conflict of interest. The individual(s) who conducts an adjudication must not be the same individual(s) who conducted the inquiry or investigation, and must be separate organizationally from the element that conducted the inquiry or investigation.
Objectivity and expertise.(3)  The recipient shall coordinate, inquire, investigate and adjudicate allegations of research misconduct promptly, but thoroughly. Generally, an investigation should be completed within 120 days of initiation, and adjudication should be complete within 60 days of receipt of the record of investigation.
Timeliness.(4)  To the extent possible, consistent with fair and thorough processing of allegations of research misconduct and applicable law and regulation, knowledge about the identity of the subjects of allegations and informants should be limited to those with a need to know.
Confidentiality.(5)  If the recipient finds that research misconduct has occurred, it shall assess the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact on the research completed or in process. The recipient must take all necessary corrective actions. Such action may include but are not limited to, correcting the research record and as appropriate imposing restrictions, controls, or other parameters on research in process or to be conducted in the future. The recipient must coordinate remedial actions with the Contracting Officer. The recipient must also consider whether personnel sanctions are appropriate. Any such sanction must be consistent with any applicable personnel laws, policies, and procedures, and must take into account the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact, whether it was done knowingly or intentionally, and whether it was an isolated event or pattern of conduct.
Remediation and sanction.(g) By executing this agreement, the recipient provides its assurance that it has established an administrative process for performing an inquiry, mediating if possible, investigating, and reporting allegations of research misconduct; and that it will comply with its own administrative process and the requirements and definitions of 10 CFR part 733 for performing an inquiry, possible mediation, investigation and reporting of allegations of research misconduct.
(h) The recipient must insert or have inserted the substance of this section, including paragraph (g), in subawards at all tiers that involve research.


910.133SECTION1§ 910.133   Deviation authority.(a)  (1) A deviation is the use of any policy, procedure, form, standard, term, or condition which varies from a requirement of this part, or the waiver of any such requirement, unless such use or waiver is authorized or precluded by Federal statute. The use of optional or discretionary provisions of this part, including special restrictive conditions used in accordance with § 910.372, exceptions under 2 CFR 200.102, and the waiver of the cost sharing requirements in § 910.130 are not deviations. Awards to foreign entities are not subject to this section.

NCSUBPARTSubpart C [Reserved]DSUBPARTSubpart D—Post Award Federal Requirements for For-Profit Entities910.350SECTION1§ 910.350   Applicability of 2 CFR part 200.(a) As stated in 2 CFR 910.22, unless otherwise noted in this part, the definition of Non-Federal entity found in 2 CFR 200.1 is expanded for DOE to include for-profit organizations in addition to states, local governments, Indian tribes, institutions of higher education (IHE), and nonprofit organizations.
(b) A for-profit organization is defined as one that distributes any profit not reinvested into the business as profit or dividends to its employees or shareholders.
(c) Subpart D of 2 CFR part 910 contains specific changes to 2 CFR part 200 that apply only to For-Profit Recipients and, unless otherwise specified, subrecipients. In some cases, the coverage in Subpart D will replace the language in a specific section of 2 CFR part 200.
[79 FR 76024, Dec. 19, 2014, as amended at 87 FR 15320, Mar. 18, 2022]


N910.352SECTION1§ 910.352   Cost Principles.For For-Profit Entities, the Cost Principles contained in 48 CFR 31.2 (Contracts with Commercial Organizations) must be followed in lieu of the Cost principles contained in 2 CFR 200.400 through 200.476, except that patent prosecution costs are not allowable unless specifically authorized in the award document. This applies to For-Profit entities whether they are recipients or subrecipients.
[79 FR 76024, Dec. 19, 2014, as amended at 87 FR 15320, Mar. 18, 2022]


N910.354SECTION1§ 910.354   Payment.(a) For-Profit Recipients are an exception to 2 CFR 200.305(b)(1) which requires that non-Federal entities be paid in advance as long as certain conditions are met.
(b) For For-Profit Recipients who are paid directly by DOE, reimbursement is the preferred method of payment. Under the reimbursement method of payment, the Federal awarding agency must reimburse the non-Federal entity for its actual cash disbursements. When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal awarding agency must make payment within 30 calendar days after receipt of the billing, unless the Federal awarding agency reasonably believes the request to be improper.


910.356SECTION1§ 910.356   Audits.See Subpart F of this part (Sections 910.500 through 910.521) for specific DOE regulations which apply to audits of DOE's For-Profit Recipients. For-Profit entities are an exception to the Single Audit requirements contained in Subpart F of 2 CFR 200 and therefore the regulations contained in 2 CFR 910 Subpart F apply instead.


910.358SECTION1§ 910.358   Profit or fee for SBIR/STTR.(a) As authorized by 2 CFR 200.400 (g), DOE may expressly allow non-federal entities to earn a profit or fee resulting from Federal financial assistance.
(b) DOE allows a profit or fee to be paid under two of its financial assistance programs only: Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR).
(c) Awards under these programs will contain a specific provision which allows a profit or fee to be paid.
(d) Profit or Fee is unallowable for all other DOE programs which award grants and cooperative agreements.


910.360SECTION1§ 910.360   Real property and equipment.(a)  Recipients may purchase real property or equipment with an acquisition cost per unit of $5,000 or more in whole or in part with Federal funds only with the prior written approval of the contracting officer or in accordance with express award terms.
Prior approvals for acquisition with Federal funds.(b)  Unless a statute specifically authorizes and the award specifies that title to property vests unconditionally in the recipient, title to real property or equipment vests in the recipient, subject to all terms and conditions of the award and that the recipient shall:
Title.(1) Use the real property or equipment for the authorized purposes of the project until funding for the project ceases, or until the real property or equipment is no longer needed for the purposes of the project, as may be determined by the contracting officer;
(2) Not encumber or permit any encumbrance on the real property or equipment without the prior written approval of the contracting officer;
(3) Use and dispose of the real property or equipment in accordance with paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section; and
(4) Properly record, and consent to the Department's ability to properly record if the recipient fails to do so, UCC financing statement(s) for all equipment purchased with Federal funds (Financial assistance awards made under the Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) program are exempt from this requirement unless otherwise specified within the grant agreement); such a filing is required when the Federal share of the financial assistance agreement is more than $1,000,000, and the Contracting Officer may require it in his or her discretion when the Federal share is less than $1,000,000. These financing statement(s) must be approved in writing by the contracting officer prior to the recording, and they shall provide notice that the recipient's title to all equipment (not real property) purchased with Federal funds under the financial assistance agreement is conditional pursuant to the terms of this section, and that the Government retains an undivided reversionary interest in the equipment. The UCC financing statement(s) must be filed before the contracting officer may reimburse the recipient for the Federal share of the equipment unless otherwise provided for in the relevant financial assistance agreement. The recipient shall further make any amendments to the financing statements or additional recordings, including appropriate continuation statements, as necessary or as the contracting officer may direct.
(c)  If the recipient fails at any time to comply with any of the conditions or requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, then the contracting officer may:
Remedies.(1) Notify the recipient of noncompliance in accordance with 2 CFR 200.339, which may lead to suspension or termination of the award;
(2) Impose special award conditions pursuant to 2 CFR 200.206 and 200.208 as amended by 910.372;
(3) Issue instructions to the recipient for disposition of the property in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section;
(4) In the case of a failure to properly record UCC financing statement(s) in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section, effect such a recording; and
(5) Apply other remedies that may be legally available.
(d)  As provided in 2 CFR 200.306(h), depending upon the purpose of the Federal award, a recipient may offer the fair market value of real property or equipment that is purchased with recipient's funds or that is donated by a third party to meet a portion of any required cost sharing or matching. If a resulting award includes such property as a portion of the recipient's cost share, the recipient holds conditional title to the property and the Government has an undivided reversionary interest in the share of the property value equal to the Federal participation in the project. The property is treated as if it had been acquired in part with Federal funds, and is subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section and to the provisions of 2 CFR 200.311 and 200.313.
Title to and Federal interest in real property or equipment offered as cost-share.(e)  Recipients must, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds as provided to property owned by the recipient.
Insurance.(f)  Unless a statute and the award terms expressly provide for the vesting of unconditional title to real property or equipment with the recipient, the real property or equipment acquired wholly or in part with Federal funds is subject to the following:
Additional uses during and after the project period.(1) During the Project Period, the recipient must make real property and equipment available for use on other projects or programs, if such other use does not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the real property or equipment was originally acquired. Use of the real property or equipment on other projects is subject to the following order of priority:
(i) Activities sponsored by DOE grants, cooperative agreements, or other assistance awards;
(ii) Activities sponsored by other Federal agencies' grants, cooperative agreements, or other assistance awards;
(iii) Activities under Federal procurement contracts or activities not sponsored by any Federal agency. If so used, use charges must be assessed to those activities. For real property or equipment, the use charges must be at rates equivalent to those for which comparable real property or equipment may be leased.
(2) After Federal funding for the project ceases, or if, as may be determined by the contracting officer, the real property or equipment is no longer needed for the purposes of the project, or if the recipient suspends work on the project, the recipient may use the real property or equipment for other projects, if:
(i) There are Federally sponsored projects for which the real property or equipment may be used;
(ii) The recipient obtains written approval from the contracting officer to do so. The contracting officer must ensure that there is a formal change of accountability for the real property or equipment to a currently funded Federal award; and
(iii) The recipient's use of the real property or equipment for other projects is in the same order of priority as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(iv) If the only use for the real property or equipment is for projects that have no Federal sponsorship, the recipient must proceed with disposition of the real property or equipment in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
(g)  (1) If, as determined by the contracting officer, an item of real property or equipment is no longer needed for Federally sponsored projects, or if the recipient has suspended work on the project, the recipient has the following options:
Disposition.(i) If the property is equipment with a current per unit fair market value of less than $5,000, it may be retained, sold, or otherwise disposed of with no further obligation to DOE.
(ii) If the property is equipment (rather than real property) and with the written approval of the contracting officer, the recipient may replace it with an item that is needed currently for the project by trading in or selling to offset the costs of the replacement equipment.
(iii) The recipient may elect to retain title, without further obligation to the Federal Government, by compensating the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the real property or equipment that is attributable to the Federal participation in the project.
(iv) If the recipient does not elect to retain title to real property or equipment or does not request approval to use equipment as trade-in or offset for replacement equipment, the recipient must request disposition instructions from the responsible agency.
(2) If a recipient requests disposition instructions, the contracting officer must:
(i) For either real property or equipment, issue instructions to the recipient for disposition of the property no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's request. The contracting officer's options for disposition are to direct the recipient to:
(A) Transfer title to the real property or equipment to the Federal Government or to a third party designated by the contracting officer provided that, in such cases, the recipient is entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the real property or equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred; or
(B) Sell the real property or equipment and pay the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property that is attributable to the Federal participation in the project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, from the sale proceeds). If the recipient is authorized or required to sell the real property or equipment, the recipient must use competitive procedures that result in the highest practicable return.
(3) If the contracting officer fails to issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days of the recipient's request, the recipient must dispose of the real property or equipment through the option described in paragraph (g)(2)(i)(B) of this section.

N910.362SECTION1§ 910.362   Intellectual property.(a)  This section sets forth the policies with regard to disposition of rights to data and to inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of, or under, a grant or cooperative agreement made to a For-Profit entity by DOE.
Scope.(b)  In accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202, if the recipient is a small business concern and receives a grant, cooperative agreement, subaward, or contract for research, developmental, or demonstration activities, then, unless there are “exceptional circumstances” as described in 35 U.S.C. 202(e), the award must contain the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart, entitled “Patents Rights (Small Business Firms and Nonprofit Organizations” which provides to the recipient the right to elect ownership of inventions made under the award.
Patents right—small business concerns.(c) —
Patent rights—other than small business concerns, e.g., large businesses(1)  Except as provided by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if the recipient is a for-profit organization other than a small business concern, as defined in 35 U.S.C. 201(h) and receives an award or a subaward for research, development, and demonstration activities, then, pursuant to statute, the award must contain the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart, entitled “Patent Rights (Large Business Firms)—No Waiver” which provides that DOE owns the patent rights to inventions made under the award.
No Patent Waiver.(2)  Paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply if:
Patent Waiver Granted.(i) DOE grants a class waiver for a particular program under 10 CFR part 784;
(ii) The applicant requests and receives an advance patent waiver under 10 CFR part 784; or
(iii) A subaward is covered by a waiver granted under the prime award.
(3)  Normally, an award will not include a background patent and data provision. However, under special circumstances, in order to provide heightened assurance of commercialization, a provision providing for a right to require licensing of third parties to background inventions, limited rights data and/or restricted computer software, may be included. Inclusion of a background patent and/or a data provision to assure commercialization will be done only with the written concurrence of the DOE program official setting forth the need for such assurance. An award may include the right to license the Government and third party contractors for special Government purposes when future availability of the technology would also benefit the government,  clean-up of DOE facilities. The scope of any such background patent and/or data licensing provision is subject to negotiation.
Special Provision.e.g.,(d)  (1) Subject to paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, and except as otherwise provided by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section or other law, any award under this subpart must contain the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart, entitled “Rights in Data—General”.
Rights in data—general rule.(2) Normally, an award will not require the delivery of limited rights data or restricted computer software. However, if the contracting officer, in consultation with DOE patent counsel and the DOE program official, determines that delivery of limited rights data or restricted computer software is necessary, the contracting officer, after negotiation with the applicant, may insert in the award the standard clause as modified by Alternates I and/or II set forth in appendix A to this subpart.
(3) If software is specified for delivery to DOE, or if other special circumstances exist,  DOE specifying “open-source” treatment of software, then the contracting officer, after negotiation with the recipient, may include in the award special provisions requiring the recipient to obtain written approval of the contracting officer prior to asserting copyright in the software, modifying the retained Government license, and/or otherwise altering the copyright provisions.
e.g.,(e)  (1) If a statute, other than those providing for the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) programs, provides for a period of time, typically up to five years, during which data produced under an award for research, development, and demonstration may be protected from public disclosure, then the contracting officer must insert in the award the standard clause in appendix A to this subpart entitled “Rights in Data—Programs Covered Under Special Protected Data Statutes” or, as determined in consultation with DOE patent counsel and the DOE program official, a modified version of such clause which may identify data or categories of data that the recipient must make available to the public.
Rights in data—programs covered under special protected data statutes.(2) An award under paragraph (e)(1) of this section is subject to the provisions of paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section.
(f)  If an applicant receives an award under the SBIR or STTR program, then the contracting officer must insert in the award the standard data clause in the General Terms and Conditions for SBIR Grants, entitled “Rights in Data—SBIR Program”.
Rights in data—SBIR/STTR programs.(g)  (1) Work performed by a recipient under a grant is not subject to authorization and consent to the use of a patented invention, and the Government assumes no liability for patent infringement by the recipient under 28 U.S.C. 1498.
Authorization and consent.(2) Work performed by a recipient under a cooperative agreement is subject to authorization and consent to the use of a patented invention consistent with the principles set forth in 48 CFR 27.201-1.
(3) The contracting officer, in consultation with patent counsel, may also include clauses in the cooperative agreement addressing other patent matters related to authorization and consent, such as patent indemnification of the Government by recipient and notice and assistance regarding patent and copyright infringement. The policies and clauses for these other patent matters will be the same or consistent with those in 48 CFR part 927.


910.364SECTION1§ 910.364   Reporting on utilization of subject inventions.(a) Unless otherwise instructed, a recipient that obtains title to an invention made under an award shall submit annual reports on the utilization or efforts to obtain utilization of the invention for at least 10 years from the date the invention was first disclosed to DOE (Utilization Reports). Utilization Reports shall include at least the following information:
(1) Status of development;
(2) Date of first commercial sale or use;
(3) Gross royalties received by the recipient;
(4) The location of any manufacture of products embodying the subject invention; and
(5) Any such other data and information as DOE may reasonably specify.
(b) To the extent data or information supplied in a Utilization Report is considered by the recipient to be privileged and confidential and is so marked by the recipient, DOE agrees that, to the extent permitted by law, it shall not disclose such information to persons outside the Government.
[80 FR 53238, Sept. 3, 2015]


N910.366SECTION1§ 910.366   Export Control and U.S. Manufacturing and Competitiveness.(a)  Any recipient of any award for research, development and/or demonstration must comply with all applicable U.S. laws regarding export control.
Export Control.(b)  It is the policy of DOE to ensure that DOE-funded research, development, and/or demonstration projects foster domestic manufacturing. Funding opportunity announcements (FOAs), therefore, may require that applicants submit a “U.S. Manufacturing Plan” in their applications. Such FOAs may encourage U.S. Manufacturing Plans to include proposals by recipients and any sub-recipients to manufacture DOE-funded technologies in the United States; however, the FOAs will also state that these plans should not include requirements regarding the source of inputs used during the manufacturing process. Regardless of whether such plans will be part of the merit review criteria or a program policy factor, and to the extent legally permissible, all awards subject to this subpart, including subawards, for research, development, and/or demonstration, must include a provision that provides plans by the recipient and any subrecipients to support manufacturing in the United States of technology developed under the award. The recipient and any subrecipients must agree to make those plans binding on any assignee or licensee or any entity otherwise acquiring rights to any subject invention or developed technology covered under the award. A recipient, subrecipient, assignee, licensee, or any entity otherwise acquiring the rights to any subject invention or developed technology may request a waiver or modification of U.S. manufacturing plans from DOE. DOE will determine whether to approve such a waiver in light of equitable considerations, including, for example, whether the requester satisfactorily shows that the planned support is not economically feasible and whether there is a satisfactory alternative net benefit to the U.S. economy if the requested waiver or modification is approved.
U.S. Manufacturing and Competitiveness.[80 FR 53239, Sept. 3, 2015]


N910.368SECTION1§ 910.368   Change of control.(a) Change of control is defined as any of the following:
(1) Any event by which any individual or entity other than the recipient becomes the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the total voting power of the voting stock of the recipient;
(2) The recipient merges with or into any entity other than in a transaction in which the shares of the recipient's voting stock are converted into a majority of the voting stock of the surviving entity;
(3) The sale, lease or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the recipient to any individual or entity other than the recipient in one or a series of related transactions;
(4) The adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation or dissolution of the recipient; or
(5) Where the recipient is a wholly-owned subsidiary at the time of award or novation, and the recipient's parent entity undergoes a change of control as defined in this section.
(b) When the Federal share of the financial assistance agreement is more than $10,000,000 or DOE requests the information in writing, the recipient must provide the contracting officer with documentation identifying all parties who exercise control in the recipient at the time of award.
(c) When there is a change of control of a recipient, or the recipient has reason to know a change of control is likely, the recipient must notify the contracting officer within 30 days of its knowledge of such change of control. Such notification must include, at a minimum, copies of documents necessary to reflect the transaction that resulted or will result in the change of control, and identification of all entities, individuals or other parties to such transaction. Failure to notify the contracting officer of a change of control is grounds for suspension or termination of the award for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the award.
(d) The contracting officer must authorize a change of control for the purposes of the award. Failure to receive the contracting officer's authorization for a change of control may lead to a suspension of the award, termination for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the award, or imposition of special award conditions pursuant to 2 CFR 910.372. Special award conditions may include but are not limited to:
(1) Additional reporting requirements related to the change of control; and
(2) Suspension of payments due to the recipient.
[80 FR 53239, Sept. 3, 2015]


N910.370SECTION1§ 910.370   Novation of financial assistance agreements.(a) Financial assistance agreements are not assignable absent written consent from the contracting officer. At his or her sole discretion, the contracting officer may, through novation, recognize a third party as the successor in interest to a financial assistance agreement if such recognition is in the Government's interest, conforms with all applicable laws and the third party's interest in the agreement arises out of the transfer of:
(1) All of the recipient's assets; or
(2) The entire portion of the assets necessary to perform the project described in the agreement.
(b) When the contracting officer determines that it is not in the Government's interest to consent to the novation of a financial assistance agreement from the original recipient to a third party, the original recipient remains subject to the terms of the financial assistance agreement, and the Department may exercise all legally available remedies under 2 CFR 200.339 through 200.343, or that may be otherwise available, should the original recipient not perform.
(c) The contracting officer may require submission of any documentation in support of a request for novation, including but not limited to documents identified in 48 CFR Subpart 42.12. The contracting officer may use the format in 48 CFR 42.1204 as guidance for novation agreements identified in paragraph (a) of this section.

N910.372SECTION1§ 910.372   Special award conditions.(a) In addition to the requirements of 2 CFR 200.206, the following actions may require the use of Specific Conditions as identified in 2 CFR 200.208:
(1) Has not conformed to the terms and conditions of a previous award;
(2) Has a change of control as defined in § 910.368;
(3) Fails to comply with real property and equipment requirements at § 910.360; or
(4) Is not otherwise responsible.

The Recipient may retain the entire right, title, and interest throughout the world to each subject invention subject to the provisions of this Patent Rights clause and 35 U.S.C. 203. With respect to any subject invention in which the Recipient retains title, the Federal Government shall have a non-exclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the U.S. the subject invention throughout the world.
(c) Invention Disclosure, Election of Title and Filing of Patent Applications by Recipient
(1) The Recipient will disclose each subject invention to DOE within two months after the inventor discloses it in writing to Recipient personnel responsible for the administration of patent matters. The disclosure to DOE shall be in the form of a written report and shall identify the award under which the invention was made and the inventor(s). It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding to the extent known at the time of disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and the physical, chemical, biological or electrical characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure. In addition, after disclosure to DOE, the Recipient will promptly notify DOE of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or public use planned by the Recipient.
(2) The Recipient will elect in writing whether or not to retain title to any such invention by notifying DOE within two years of disclosure to DOE. However, in any case where publication, on sale, or public use has initiated the one-year statutory period wherein valid patent protection can still be obtained in the U.S., the period for election of title may be shortened by the agency to a date that is no more than 60 days prior to the end of the statutory period.
(3) The Recipient will file its initial patent application on an invention to which it elects to retain title within one year after election of title or, if earlier, prior to the end of any statutory period wherein valid patent protection can be obtained in the U.S. after a publication, on sale, or public use. The Recipient will file patent applications in additional countries or international patent offices within either ten months of the corresponding initial patent application, or six months from the date when permission is granted by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent applications when such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.
(4) Requests for extension of the time for disclosure to DOE, election, and filing under subparagraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this clause may, at the discretion of DOE, be granted.
(d) Conditions When the Government May Obtain Title
The Recipient will convey to DOE, upon written request, title to any subject invention:
(1) If the Recipient fails to disclose or elect the subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this patent rights clause, or elects not to retain title; provided that DOE may only request title within 60 days after learning of the failure of the Recipient to disclose or elect within the specified times;
(2) In those countries in which the Recipient fails to file patent applications within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this Patent Rights clause; provided, however, that if the Recipient has filed a patent application in a country after the times specified in paragraph (c) of this Patent Rights clause, but prior to its receipt of the written request of DOE, the Recipient shall continue to retain title in that country; or
(3) In any country in which the Recipient decides not to continue the prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a subject invention.
(e) Minimum Rights to Recipient and Protection of the Recipient Right To File
(1) The Recipient will retain a non-exclusive royalty-free license throughout the world in each subject invention to which the Government obtains title, except if the Recipient fails to disclose the subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this Patent Rights clause. The Recipient's license extends to its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the Recipient is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope of the extent the Recipient was legally obligated to do so at the time the award was awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of DOE except when transferred to the successor of that part of the Recipient's business to which the invention pertains.
(2) The Recipient's domestic license may be revoked or modified by DOE to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with applicable provisions at 37 CFR part 404 and the agency's licensing regulation, if any. This license will not be revoked in that field of use or the geographical areas in which the Recipient has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at discretion of the funding Federal agency to the extent the Recipient, its licensees, or its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that foreign country.
(3) Before revocation or modification of the license, the funding Federal agency will furnish the Recipient a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Recipient will be allowed thirty days (or such other time as may be authorized by DOE for good cause shown by the Recipient) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The Recipient has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404 and the agency's licensing regulations, if any, concerning the licensing of Government-owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of its license.
(f) Recipient Action To Protect Government's Interest
(1) The Recipient agrees to execute or to have executed and promptly deliver to DOE all instruments necessary to:
(i) Establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout the world in those subject inventions for which the Recipient retains title; and
(ii) Convey title to DOE when requested under paragraph (d) of this Patent Rights clause, and to enable the government to obtain patent protection throughout the world in that subject invention.
(2) The Recipient agrees to require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and non-technical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the Recipient each subject invention made under this award in order that the Recipient can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this Patent Rights clause, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions. The disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information requested by paragraph (c)(1) of this Patent Rights clause. The Recipient shall instruct such employees through the employee agreements or other suitable educational programs on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.
(3) The Recipient will notify DOE of any decision not to continue prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country, not less than 30 days before the expiration of the response period required by the relevant patent office.
(4) The Recipient agrees to include, within the specification of any U.S. patent application and any patent issuing thereon covering a subject invention, the following statement: “This invention was made with Government support under (identify the award) awarded by (identify DOE). The Government has certain rights in this invention.”
(g) Subaward/Contract
(1) The Recipient will include this Patent Rights clause, suitably modified to identify the parties, in all subawards/contracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental or research work to be performed by a small business firm or nonprofit organization. The subrecipient/contractor will retain all rights provided for the Recipient in this Patent Rights clause, and the Recipient will not, as part of the consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractors' subject inventions.
(2) The Recipient will include in all other subawards/contracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental or research work, the patent rights clause required by 2 CFR 910.362(c).
(3) In the case of subawards/contracts at any tier, DOE, the Recipient, and the subrecipient/contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subrecipient/contractor and DOE with respect to those matters covered by the clause.
(h) Reporting on Utilization of Subject Inventions
The Recipient agrees to submit on request periodic reports no more frequently than annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization that are being made by the Recipient or its licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include information regarding the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the Recipient and such other data and information as DOE may reasonably specify. The Recipient also agrees to provide additional reports in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken by DOE in accordance with paragraph (j) of this Patent Rights clause. As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), DOE agrees it will not disclose such information to persons outside the Government without the permission of the Recipient.
(i) Preference for United States Industry.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Patent Rights clause, the Recipient agrees that neither it nor any assignee will grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the U.S. unless such person agrees that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the U.S. However, in individual cases, the requirement for such an agreement may be waived by DOE upon a showing by the Recipient or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the U.S. or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.
(j) March-in-Rights
The Recipient agrees that with respect to any subject invention in which it has acquired title, DOE has the right in accordance with procedures at 37 CFR 401.6 and any supplemental regulations of the Agency to require the Recipient, an assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a non-exclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances and if the Recipient, assignee, or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, DOE has the right to grant such a license itself if DOE determines that:
(1) Such action is necessary because the Recipient or assignee has not taken or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention in such field of use;
(2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by the Recipient, assignee, or their licensees;
(3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the Recipient, assignee, or licensee; or
(4) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by paragraph (i) of this Patent Rights clause has not been obtained or waived or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the U.S. is in breach of such agreement.
(k) Special Provisions for Awards With Nonprofit Organizations
If the Recipient is a nonprofit organization, it agrees that:
(1) Rights to a subject invention in the U.S. may not be assigned without the approval of DOE, except where such assignment is made to an organization which has as one of its primary functions the management of inventions, provided that such assignee will be subject to the same provisions as the Recipient;
(2) The Recipient will share royalties collected on a subject invention with the inventor, including Federal employee co-inventors (when DOE deems it appropriate) when the subject invention is assigned in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(e) and 37 CFR 401.10;
(3) The balance of any royalties or income earned by the Recipient with respect to subject inventions, after payment of expenses (including payments to inventors) incidental to the administration of subject inventions, will be utilized for the support of scientific or engineering research or education; and
(4) It will make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business firms and that it will give preference to a small business firm if the Recipient determines that the small business firm has a plan or proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are not small business firms; provided that the Recipient is also satisfied that the small business firm has the capability and resources to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision whether to give a preference in any specific case will be at the discretion of the Recipient. However, the Recipient agrees that the Secretary of Commerce may review the Recipient's licensing program and decisions regarding small business applicants, and the Recipient will negotiate changes to its licensing policies, procedures or practices with the Secretary when the Secretary's review discloses that the Recipient could take reasonable steps to implement more effectively the requirements of this paragraph (k)(4).

(1) Data delivered to the Government without either the limited rights or restricted rights notice as authorized by paragraph (g) of this clause, or the copyright notice required by paragraph (c) of this clause, shall be deemed to have been furnished with unlimited rights, and the Government assumes no liability for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of such data. However, to the extent the data has not been disclosed without restriction outside the Government, the Recipient may request, within 6 months (or a longer time approved by the Contracting Officer for good cause shown) after delivery or such data, permission to have notices placed on qualifying data at the Recipient's expense, and the Contracting Officer may agree to do so if the Recipient:
(i) Identifies the data to which the omitted notice is to be applied;
(ii) Demonstrates that the omission of the notice was inadvertent;
(iii) Establishes that the use of the proposed notice is authorized; and
(iv) Acknowledges that the Government has no liability with respect to the disclosure, use, or reproduction of any such data made prior to the addition of the notice or resulting from the omission of the notice.
(2) The Contracting Officer may also:
(i) Permit correction at the Recipient's expense of incorrect notices if the Recipient identifies the data on which correction of the notice is to be made, and demonstrates that the correct notice is authorized, or
(ii) Correct any incorrect notices.
(g) Protection of Limited Rights Data and Restricted Computer Software
When data other than that listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this clause are specified to be delivered under this agreement and qualify as either limited rights data or restricted computer software, if the Recipient desires to continue protection of such data, the Recipient shall withhold such data and not furnish them to the Government under this agreement. As a condition to this withholding, the Recipient shall identify the data being withheld and furnish form, fit, and function data in lieu thereof. Limited rights data that are formatted as a computer data base for delivery to the Government are to be treated as limited rights data and not restricted computer software.
(h) Subaward/Contract
The Recipient has the responsibility to obtain from its subrecipients/contractors all data and rights therein necessary to fulfill the Recipient's obligations to the Government under this agreement. If a subrecipient/contractor refuses to accept terms affording the Government such rights, the Recipient shall promptly bring such refusal to the attention of the Contracting Officer and not proceed with the subaward/contract award without further authorization.
(i) Additional Data Requirements
In addition to the data specified elsewhere in this agreement to be delivered, the Contracting Officer may, at any time during agreement performance or within a period of 3 years after acceptance of all items to be delivered under this agreement, order any data first produced or specifically used in the performance of this agreement. This clause is applicable to all data ordered under this subparagraph. Nothing contained in this subparagraph shall require the Recipient to deliver any data the withholding of which is authorized by this clause, or data which are specifically identified in this agreement as not subject to this clause. When data are to be delivered under this subparagraph, the Recipient will be compensated for converting the data into the prescribed form, for reproduction, and for delivery.
(j) The recipient agrees, except as may be otherwise specified in this award for specific data items listed as not subject to this paragraph, that the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative may, up to three years after acceptance of all items to be delivered under this award, inspect at the Recipient's facility any data withheld pursuant to paragraph (g) of this clause, for purposes of verifying the Recipient's assertion pertaining to the limited rights or restricted rights status of the data or for evaluating work performance. Where the Recipient whose data are to be inspected demonstrates to the Contracting Officer that there would be a possible conflict of interest if the inspection were made by a particular representative, the Contracting Officer shall designate an alternate inspector.
As prescribed in 2 CFR 910.362(d)(1), the following Alternate I and/or II may be inserted in the clause in the award instrument.
(g)(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1) of this clause, the agreement may identify and specify the delivery of limited rights data, or the Contracting Officer may require by written request the delivery of limited rights data that has been withheld or would otherwise be withholdable. If delivery of such data is so required, the Recipient may affix the following “Limited Rights Notice” to the data and the Government will thereafter treat the data, in accordance with such Notice:
(a) These data are submitted with limited rights under Government agreement No. ____ (and subaward/contract No. ______, if appropriate). These data may be reproduced and used by the Government with the express limitation that they will not, without written permission of the Recipient, be used for purposes of manufacture nor disclosed outside the Government; except that the Government may disclose these data outside the Government for the following purposes, if any, provided that the Government makes such disclosure subject to prohibition against further use and disclosure:
(1) Use (except for manufacture) by Federal support services contractors within the scope of their contracts;
(2) This “limited rights data” may be disclosed for evaluation purposes under the restriction that the “limited rights data” be retained in confidence and not be further disclosed;
(3) This “limited rights data” may be disclosed to other contractors participating in the Government's program of which this Recipient is a part for information or use (except for manufacture) in connection with the work performed under their awards and under the restriction that the “limited rights data” be retained in confidence and not be further disclosed;
(4) This “limited rights data” may be used by the Government or others on its behalf for emergency repair or overhaul work under the restriction that the “limited rights data” be retained in confidence and not be further disclosed; and
(5) Release to a foreign government, or instrumentality thereof, as the interests of the United States Government may require, for information or evaluation, or for emergency repair or overhaul work by such government. This Notice shall be marked on any reproduction of this data in whole or in part.
(b) This Notice shall be marked on any reproduction of these data, in whole or in part.
(g)(3)(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1) of this clause, the agreement may identify and specify the delivery of restricted computer software, or the Contracting Officer may require by written request the delivery of restricted computer software that has been withheld or would otherwise be withholdable. If delivery of such computer software is so required, the Recipient may affix the following “Restricted Rights Notice” to the computer software and the Government will thereafter treat the computer software, subject to paragraphs (e) and (f) of this clause, in accordance with the Notice.
(a) This computer software is submitted with restricted rights under Government Agreement No.________ (and subaward/contract ________, if appropriate). It may not be used, reproduced, or disclosed by the Government except as provided in paragraph (b) of this Notice or as otherwise expressly stated in the agreement.
(b) This computer software may be—
(1) Used or copies for use in or with the computer or computers for which it was acquired, including use at any Government installation to which such computer or computers may be transferred;
(2) Used or copied for use in a backup computer if any computer or which it was acquired is inoperative;
(3) Reproduced for safekeeping (archives) or backup purposes;
(4) Modified, adapted, or combined with other computer software, provided that the modified, combined, or adapted portions of the derivative software are made subject to the same restricted rights;

(6) Used or copied for use in or transferred to a replacement computer.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this computer software is published copyrighted computer software, it is licensed to the Government, without disclosure prohibitions, with the minimum rights set forth in paragraph (b) of this clause.
(d) Any other rights or limitations regarding the use, duplication, or disclosure of this computer software are to be expressly stated, in, or incorporated in, the agreement.
(e) This Notice shall be marked on any reproduction of this computer software, in whole or in part.
(ii) Where it is impractical to include the Restricted Rights Notice on restricted computer software, the following short-form Notice may be used in lieu thereof:
Use, reproduction, or disclosure is subject to restrictions set forth in agreement No. ______ (and subaward/contract______, If appropriate) with ______(name of Recipient and subrecipient/contractor).
(iii) If restricted computer software is delivered with the copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401, it will be presumed to be published copyrighted computer software licensed to the government without disclosure prohibitions, with the minimum rights set forth in paragraph (b) of this clause, unless the Recipient includes the following statement with such copyright notice: “Unpublished—rights reserved under the Copyright Laws of the United States.”

The Government shall continue to abide by the markings under this subdivision (e)(1)(iii) until final resolution of the matter either by the Contracting Officer's determination become final (in which instance the Government shall thereafter have the right to cancel or ignore the markings at any time and the data will no longer be made subject to any disclosure prohibitions), or by final disposition of the matter by court decision if suit is filed.
(2) The time limits in the procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this clause may be modified in accordance with agency regulations implementing the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if necessary to respond to a request thereunder.
(f) Omitted or Incorrect Markings
(1) Data delivered to the Government without either the limited rights or restricted rights notice as authorized by paragraph () of this clause, or the copyright notice required by paragraph (c) of this clause, shall be deemed to have been furnished with unlimited rights, and the Government assumes no liability for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of such data. However, to the extent the data has not been disclosed without restriction outside the Government, the Recipient may request, within 6 months (or a longer time approved by the Contracting Officer for good cause shown) after delivery of such data, permission to have notices placed on qualifying data at the Recipient's expense, and the Contracting Officer may agree to do so if the Recipient—
g(i) Identifies the data to which the omitted notice is to be applied;
(ii) Demonstrates that the omission of the notice was inadvertent;
(iii) Establishes that the use of the proposed notice is authorized; and

(ii) Correct any incorrect notices.
(g) Rights to Protected Data
(1) The Recipient may, with the concurrence of DOE, claim and mark as protected data, any data first produced in the performance of this award that would have been treated as a trade secret if developed at private expense. Any such claimed “protected data” will be clearly marked with the following Protected Rights Notice, and will be treated in accordance with such Notice, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (e) and (f) of this clause.
These protected data were produced under agreement no. ______ with the U.S. Department of Energy and may not be published, disseminated, or disclosed to others outside the Government until (Note:) The period of protection of such data is fully negotiable, but cannot exceed the applicable statutorily authorized maximum), unless express written authorization is obtained from the recipient. Upon expiration of the period of protection set forth in this Notice, the Government shall have unlimited rights in this data. This Notice shall be marked on any reproduction of this data, in whole or in part.
(2) Any such marked Protected Data may be disclosed under obligations of confidentiality for the following purposes:
(a) For evaluation purposes under the restriction that the “Protected Data” be retained in confidence and not be further disclosed; or
(b) To subcontractors or other team members performing work under the Government's (insert name of program or other applicable activity) program of which this award is a part, for information or use in connection with the work performed under their activity, and under the restriction that the Protected Data be retained in confidence and not be further disclosed.
(3) The obligations of confidentiality and restrictions on publication and dissemination shall end for any Protected Data.
(a) At the end of the protected period;
(b) If the data becomes publicly known or available from other sources without a breach of the obligation of confidentiality with respect to the Protected Data;
(c) If the same data is independently developed by someone who did not have access to the Protected Data and such data is made available without obligations of confidentiality; or
(d) If the Recipient disseminates or authorizes another to disseminate such data without obligations of confidentiality.
(4) However, the Recipient agrees that the following types of data are not considered to be protected and shall be provided to the Government when required by this award without any claim that the data are Protected Data. The parties agree that notwithstanding the following lists of types of data, nothing precludes the Government from seeking delivery of additional data in accordance with this award, or from making publicly available additional non-protected data, nor does the following list constitute any admission by the Government that technical data not on the list is Protected Data. (Note: It is expected that this paragraph will specify certain types of mutually agreed upon data that will be available to the public and will not be asserted by the recipient/contractor as limited rights or protected data).
(5) The Government's sole obligation with respect to any protected data shall be as set forth in this paragraph (g).
(h) Protection of Limited Rights Data
When data other than that listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this clause are specified to be delivered under this agreement and such data qualify as either limited rights data or restricted computer software, the Recipient, if the Recipient desires to continue protection of such data, shall withhold such data and not furnish them to the Government under this agreement. As a condition to this withholding the Recipient shall identify the data being withheld and furnish form, fit, and function data in lieu thereof.
(i) Subaward/Contract
The Recipient has the responsibility to obtain from its subrecipients/contractors all data and rights therein necessary to fulfill the Recipient's obligations to the Government under this agreement. If a subrecipient/contractor refuses to accept terms affording the Government such rights, the Recipient shall promptly bring such refusal to the attention of the Contracting Officer and not proceed with subaward/contract award without further authorization.
(j) Additional Data Requirements
In addition to the data specified elsewhere in this agreement to be delivered, the Contracting Officer may, at any time during agreement performance or within a period of 3 years after acceptance of all items to be delivered under this agreement, order any data first produced or specifically used in the performance of this agreement. This clause is applicable to all data ordered under this subparagraph. Nothing contained in this subparagraph shall require the Recipient to deliver any data the withholding of which is authorized by this clause or data which are specifically identified in this agreement as not subject to this clause. When data are to be delivered under this subparagraph, the Recipient will be compensated for converting the data into the prescribed form, for reproduction, and for delivery.
(k) The Recipient agrees, except as may be otherwise specified in this agreement for specific data items listed as not subject to this paragraph, that the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative may, up to three years after acceptance of all items to be delivered under this contract, inspect at the Recipient's facility any data withheld pursuant to paragraph (h) of this clause, for purposes of verifying the Recipient's assertion pertaining to the limited rights or restricted rights status of the data or for evaluating work performance. Where the Recipient whose data are to be inspected demonstrates to the Contracting Officer that there would be a possible conflict of interest if the inspection were made by a particular representative, the Contracting Officer shall designate an alternate inspector.
As prescribed in 2 CFR 910.362(e)(2), the following Alternate I and/or II may be inserted in the clause in the award instrument.
(h)(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(1) of this clause, the agreement may identify and specify the delivery of limited rights data, or the Contracting Officer may require by written request the delivery of limited rights data that has been withheld or would otherwise be withholdable. If delivery of such data is so required, the Recipient may affix the following “Limited Rights Notice” to the data and the Government will thereafter treat the data, in accordance with such Notice:

(4) This “limited rights data” may be used by the Government or others on its behalf for emergency repair or overhaul work under the restriction that the “limited rights data” be retained in confidence and not be further disclosed; and
(5) Release to a foreign government, or instrumentality thereof, as the interests of the United States Government may require, for information or evaluation, or for emergency repair or overhaul work by such government. This Notice shall be marked on any reproduction of this data in whole or in part.
(b) This Notice shall be marked on any reproduction of these data, in whole or in part.
(h)(3)(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(1) of this clause, the agreement may identify and specify the delivery of restricted computer software, or the Contracting Officer may require by written request the delivery of restricted computer software that has been withheld or would otherwise be withholdable. If delivery of such computer software is so required, the Recipient may affix the following “Restricted Rights Notice” to the computer software and the Government will thereafter treat the computer software, subject to paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause, in accordance with the Notice:

NESUBPARTSubpart E—Cost Principles910.401SECTION1§ 910.401   Application to M&O's.In accordance with 48 CFR 970.3002-1 and 970.3101-00-70, a Federally Funded Research Center (FFRDC) which is also a designated DOE Management and Operating (M&O) contract must follow the cost accounting standards (CAS) contained in 48 CFR part 30 and must follow the appropriate Cost Principles contained in 48 CFR part 31.


FSUBPARTSubpart F—Audit Requirements for For-Profit EntitiesECFRd586c3cea76ac97SUBJGRPGeneral910.500SECTION1§ 910.500   Purpose.This Part follows the same format as 2 CFR 200.500. We purposely did not renumber the paragraphs within this part so that auditors and recipients can compare this to the single audit requirements contained in 2 CFR 200.500.


ECFR95866d6a7902d73SUBJGRPAudits910.501SECTION1§ 910.501   Audit requirements.(a)  A for-profit entity that expends $750,000 or more during the non-Federal entity's fiscal year in DOE awards must have a compliance audit conducted for that year in accordance with the provisions of this Part.
Audit required.(b)  (1) If a for-profit entity has one or more DOE awards with expenditures of $750,000 or more during the for-profit entity's fiscal year, they must have a compliance audit for each of the awards with $750,000 or more in expenditures. A compliance audit should comply with the applicable provisions in § 910.514—Scope of Audit. The remaining awards do not require, individually or in the aggregate, a compliance audit.
Compliance audit.(2) If a for-profit entity receives more than one award from DOE with a sum total of expenditures of $750,000 or more during the for-profit entity's fiscal year, but does not have any single award with expenditures of $750,000 or more; the entity must determine whether any or all of the awards have common compliance requirements ( are considered a cluster of awards) and determine the total expenditures of the awards with common compliance requirements. A compliance audit is required for the largest cluster of awards (if multiple clusters of awards exist) or the largest award not in a cluster of awards, whichever corresponding expenditure total is greater. A compliance audit should comply with the applicable provisions in § 910.514—Scope of Audit. The remaining awards do not require, individually or in the aggregate, a compliance audit;
i.e.,(3) If a for-profit entity receives one or more awards from DOE with a sum total of expenditures less than $750,000, no compliance audit is required;
(4) If the for-profit entity is a sub-recipient, 2 CFR 200.501(h) requires that the pass-through entity establish appropriate monitoring and controls to ensure the sub-recipient complies with award requirements. These compliance audits must be conducted in accordance with 2 CFR 200.514 Scope of audit
(c)  Not applicable.
Program-specific audit election.(d)  A for-profit entity that expends less than $750,000 during the for-profit's fiscal year in DOE awards is exempt from DOE audit requirements for that year, except as noted in § 910.503 Relation to other audit requirements, but records must be available for review or audit by appropriate officials of the Federal agency, pass-through entity, and Government Accountability Office (GAO).
Exemption when Federal awards expended are less than $750,000.(e)  Management of an auditee that owns or operates a FFRDC may elect to treat the FFRDC as a separate entity for purposes of this part.
Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC).(f)  An auditee may simultaneously be a recipient, a subrecipient, and a contractor. Federal awards expended as a recipient are subject to audit under this part. The payments received for goods or services provided as a contractor are not Federal awards. The provisions of 2 CFR 200.331, Subrecipient and contractor determinations should be considered in determining whether payments constitute a Federal award or a payment for goods or services provided as a contractor.
Subrecipients and Contractors.(g)  In most cases, the auditee's compliance responsibility for contractors is only to ensure that the procurement, receipt, and payment for goods and services comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards. Federal award compliance requirements normally do not pass through to contractors. However, the auditee is responsible for ensuring compliance for procurement transactions which are structured such that the contractor is responsible for program compliance or the contractor's records must be reviewed to determine program compliance. Also, when these procurement transactions relate to a major program, the scope of the audit must include determining whether these transactions are in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards.
Compliance responsibility for contractors.(h)  Since this part does not apply to for-profit subrecipients, the pass-through entity is responsible for establishing requirements, as necessary, to ensure compliance by for-profit subrecipients to DOE Federal award requirements. The agreement with the for-profit subrecipient should describe applicable compliance requirements and the for- profit subrecipient's compliance responsibility. Methods to ensure compliance for Federal awards made to for-profit subrecipients may include pre-award audits, monitoring during the agreement, and post-award audits.

N910.502SECTION1§ 910.502   Basis for determining DOE awards expended.(a)  The determination of when a Federal award is expended must be based on when the activity related to the DOE award occurs. Generally, the activity pertains to events that require the non-Federal entity to comply with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of DOE awards, such as: Expenditure/expense transactions associated with awards including grants, cost-reimbursement contracts under the FAR, compacts with Indian Tribes, cooperative agreements, and direct appropriations; the disbursement of funds to subrecipients; the use of loan proceeds under loan and loan guarantee programs; the receipt of property; the receipt of surplus property; the receipt or use of program income; the distribution or use of food commodities; the disbursement of amounts entitling the for-profit entity to an interest subsidy; and the period when insurance is in force.
Determining Federal awards expended.(b)  Loan and loan guarantees issued by the DOE Loan Program Office corresponding to Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 16511-16516 (“Title XVII”) are exempt from these provisions.
Loan and loan guarantees (loans).(1) Not applicable.
(2) Not applicable.
(3) Not applicable.
(c) Not applicable.
(d)  See paragraph (b) of this section.
Prior loan and loan guarantees (loans).(e)  The cumulative balance of DOE awards for endowment funds that are federally restricted are considered DOE awards expended in each audit period in which the funds are still restricted.
Endowment funds.(f)  Free rent received by itself is not considered a DOE award expended under this Part. However, free rent received as part of a DOE award to carry out a DOE program must be included in determining DOE awards expended and subject to audit under this part.
Free rent.(g)  DOE non-cash assistance, such as free rent, food commodities, donated property, or donated surplus property, must be valued at fair market value at the time of receipt or the assessed value provided by DOE.
Valuing non-cash assistance.(h) Not applicable.

N910.503SECTION1§ 910.503   Relation to other audit requirements.(a) An audit conducted in accordance with this Part must be in lieu of any financial audit of DOE awards which a for-profit entity is required to undergo under any other Federal statute or regulation. To the extent that such audit provides DOE with the information it requires to carry out its responsibilities under Federal statute or regulation, DOE must rely upon and use that information.
(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, DOE, Inspectors General, or GAO may conduct or arrange for additional audits which are necessary to carry out its responsibilities under Federal statute or regulation. The provisions of this Part do not authorize any for-profit entity to constrain, in any manner, DOE from carrying out or arranging for such additional audits, except that DOE must plan such audits to not be duplicative of other audits of DOE. Any additional audits must be planned and performed in such a way as to build upon work performed, including the audit documentation, sampling, and testing already performed, by other auditors.
(c) The provisions of this Part do not limit the authority of DOE to conduct, or arrange for the conduct of, audits and evaluations of DOE awards, nor limit the authority of any Federal agency Inspector General or other Federal official.
(d) DOE to pay for additional audits. If DOE conducts or arranges for additional audits it must, consistent with other applicable Federal statutes and regulations, arrange for funding the full cost of such additional audits.

NECFRc420433389ca503SUBJGRPAuditees910.508SECTION1§ 910.508   Auditee responsibilities.The auditee must:
(a) Procure or otherwise arrange for the audit required by this Part in accordance with § 910.509 Auditor selection, and ensure it is properly performed and submitted when due in accordance with § 910.512 Report submission.
(b) Submit appropriate financial statements (if available).
(c) Submit the schedule of expenditures of DOE awards in accordance with § 910.510 Financial statements.
(d) Promptly follow up and take corrective action on audit findings, including preparation of a summary schedule of prior audit findings and a corrective action plan in accordance with § 910.511 Audit findings follow- up, paragraph (b) and § 910.511 Audit findings follow-up, paragraph (c), respectively.
(e) Provide the auditor with access to personnel, accounts, books, records, supporting documentation, and other information as needed for the auditor to perform the audit required by this Part.


910.509SECTION1§ 910.509   Auditor selection.(a)  When procuring audit services, the objective is to obtain high-quality audits. In requesting proposals for audit services, the objectives and scope of the audit must be made clear and the for-profit entity must request a copy of the audit organization's peer review report which the auditor is required to provide under GAGAS. Factors to be considered in evaluating each proposal for audit services include the responsiveness to the request for proposal, relevant experience, availability of staff with professional qualifications and technical abilities, the results of peer and external quality control reviews, and price. Whenever possible, the auditee must make positive efforts to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, in procuring audit services as stated in 2 CFR 200.321 Contracting with small and minority businesses, women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms, or the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable.
Auditor procurement.(b)  An auditor who prepares the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan may not also be selected to perform the audit required by this Part when the indirect costs recovered by the auditee during the prior year exceeded $1 million. This restriction applies to the base year used in the preparation of the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan and any subsequent years in which the resulting indirect cost agreement or cost allocation plan is used to recover costs.
Restriction on auditor preparing indirect cost proposals.(c)  Federal auditors may perform all or part of the work required under this Part if they comply fully with the requirements of this Part.


Use of Federal auditors.910.510SECTION1§ 910.510   Financial statements.(a)  If available, the auditee must submit financial statements that reflect its financial position, results of operations or changes in net assets, and, where appropriate, cash flows for the fiscal year audited. The financial statements must be for the same organizational unit and fiscal year that is chosen to meet the requirements of this Part. However, for-profit entity-wide financial statements may also include departments, agencies, and other organizational units that have separate audits in accordance with § 910.514 Scope of audit, paragraph (a) and prepare separate financial statements.
Financial statements.(b)  The auditee must prepare a schedule of expenditures of DOE awards for the period covered by the auditee's fiscal year which must include the total DOE awards expended as determined in accordance with § 910.502 Basis for determining DOE awards expended. While not required, the auditee may choose to provide information requested by DOE and pass- through entities to make the schedule easier to use. For example, when a DOE program has multiple DOE award years, the auditee may list the amount of DOE awards expended for each DOE award year separately. At a minimum, the schedule must:
Schedule of expenditures of DOE awards.(1) List individual DOE programs. For a cluster of programs, provide the cluster name, list individual DOE programs within the cluster of programs. For R&D, total DOE awards expended must be shown by individual DOE award and major subdivision within DOE. For example, the National Institutes of Health is a major subdivision in the Department of Health and Human Services.
(2) Not applicable.
(3) Provide total DOE awards expended for each individual DOE program and the CFDA number For a cluster of programs also provide the total for the cluster.
(4) Not applicable.
(5) Not applicable.
(6) Include notes that describe that significant accounting policies used in preparing the schedule, and note whether or not the for-profit entity elected to use the 10% de minimis cost rate as covered in 2 CFR 200.414 Indirect (F&A) costs.


910.511SECTION1§ 910.511   Audit findings follow-up.(a)  The auditee is responsible for follow-up and corrective action on all audit findings. As part of this responsibility, the auditee must prepare a summary schedule of prior audit findings. The auditee must also prepare a corrective action plan for current year audit findings. The summary schedule of prior audit findings and the corrective action plan must include the reference numbers the auditor assigns to audit findings under § 910.516 Audit findings, paragraph (c). Since the summary schedule may include audit findings from multiple years, it must include the fiscal year in which the finding initially occurred. The corrective action plan and summary schedule of prior audit findings must include findings relating to the financial statements which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.
General.(b)  The summary schedule of prior audit findings must report the status of all audit findings included in the prior audit's schedule of findings and questioned costs. The summary schedule must also include audit findings reported in the prior audit's summary schedule of prior audit findings except audit findings listed as corrected in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or no longer valid or not warranting further action in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
Summary schedule of prior audit findings.(1) When audit findings were fully corrected, the summary schedule need only list the audit findings and state that corrective action was taken.
(2) When audit findings were not corrected or were only partially corrected, the summary schedule must describe the reasons for the finding's recurrence and planned corrective action, and any partial corrective action taken. When corrective action taken is significantly different from corrective action previously reported in a corrective action plan or in DOE's or pass-through entity's management decision, the summary schedule must provide an explanation.
(3) When the auditee believes the audit findings are no longer valid or do not warrant further action, the reasons for this position must be described in the summary schedule. A valid reason for considering an audit finding as not warranting further action is that all of the following have occurred:
(i) Two years have passed since the audit report in which the finding occurred was submitted to DOE;
(ii) DOE is not currently following up with the auditee on the audit finding; and
(iii) A management decision was not issued.
(c)  At the completion of the audit, the auditee must prepare, in a document separate from the auditor's findings described in § 910.516 Audit findings, a corrective action plan to address each audit finding included in the current year auditor's reports. The corrective action plan must provide the name(s) of the contact person(s) responsible for corrective action, the corrective action planned, and the anticipated completion date. If the auditee does not agree with the audit findings or believes corrective action is not required, then the corrective action plan must include an explanation and specific reasons.


Corrective action plan.910.512SECTION1§ 910.512   Report submission.(a)  (1) The audit must be completed and the reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section must be submitted within the earlier of 30 calendar days after receipt of the auditor's report(s), or nine months after the end of the audit period. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the reporting package is due the next business day.
General.(2) Unless restricted by Federal statutes or regulations, the auditee must make copies available for public inspection. Auditees and auditors must ensure that their respective parts of the reporting package do not include protected personally identifiable information.
(b)  See paragraph (b)(1) of this section:
Data collection.(1) A senior level representative of the auditee ( director of finance, chief executive officer, or chief financial officer) must sign a statement to be included as part of the reporting package that says that the auditee complied with the requirements of this Part, the reporting package does not include protected personally identifiable information, and the information included in its entirety is accurate and complete.
e.g.,(2) Not applicable.
(3) Not applicable.
(c)  The reporting package must include the:
Reporting package.(1) Financial statements (if available) and schedule of expenditures of DOE awards discussed in § 910.510 Financial statements, paragraphs (a) and (b), respectively;

NECFR42ed9d24ac60437SUBJGRPAuditors910.514SECTION1§ 910.514   Scope of audit.(a)  The audit must be conducted in accordance with GAGAS. The audit must cover the entire operations of the auditee, or, at the option of the auditee, such audit must include a series of audits that cover departments, agencies, and other organizational units that expended or otherwise administered DOE awards during such audit period, provided that each such audit must encompass the schedule of expenditures of DOE awards for each such department, agency, and other organizational unit, which must be considered to be a for-profit entity. The financial statements (if available) and schedule of expenditures of DOE awards must be for the same audit period.
General.(b)  If financial statements are available, the auditor must determine whether the schedule of expenditures of DOE awards is stated fairly in all material respects in relation to the auditee's financial statements as a whole.
Financial statements.(c)  (1) The compliance supplement provides guidance on internal controls over Federal programs based upon the guidance in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government issued by the Comptroller General of the United States and the Internal Control—Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
Internal control.(2) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS the auditor must perform procedures to obtain an understanding of internal control over DOE programs sufficient to plan the audit to support a low assessed level of control risk of noncompliance for major programs.
(3) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the auditor must:
(i) Plan the testing of internal control over compliance to support a low assessed level of control risk for the assertions relevant to the compliance requirements; and
(ii) Perform testing of internal control as planned in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.
(4) When internal control over some or all of the compliance requirements are likely to be ineffective in preventing or detecting noncompliance, the planning and performing of testing described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section are not required for those compliance requirements. However, the auditor must report a significant deficiency or material weakness in accordance with § 910.516 Audit findings, assess the related control risk at the maximum, and consider whether additional compliance tests are required because of ineffective internal control.
(d)  (1) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor must determine whether the auditee has complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of Federal awards that may have a direct and material effect.
Compliance.(2) The principal compliance requirements applicable to most Federal programs and the compliance requirements of the largest Federal programs are included in the compliance supplement.
(3) For the compliance requirements related to Federal programs contained in the compliance supplement, an audit of these compliance requirements will meet the requirements of this part. Where there have been changes to the compliance requirements and the changes are not reflected in the compliance supplement, the auditor must determine the current compliance requirements and modify the audit procedures accordingly. For those Federal programs not covered in the compliance supplement, the auditor should follow the compliance supplement's guidance for programs not included in the supplement.
(4) The compliance testing must include tests of transactions and such other auditing procedures necessary to provide the auditor sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support an opinion on compliance.
(e)  The auditor must follow-up on prior audit findings, perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with § 910.511 Audit findings follow-up paragraph (b), and report, as a current year audit finding, when the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding.

(a) An opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the financial statements (if available) are presented fairly in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the schedule of expenditures of DOE awards is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the financial statements (if available) as a whole.
(b) A report on internal control over financial reporting and compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the DOE award, noncompliance with which could have a material effect on the financial statements. This report must describe the scope of testing of internal control and compliance and the results of the tests, and, where applicable, it will refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section.
(c) A report on compliance and report and internal control over compliance. This report must describe the scope of testing of internal control over compliance, include an opinion or modified opinion as to whether the auditee complied with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of DOE awards which could have a direct and material effect and refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section.
(d) A schedule of findings and questioned costs which must include the following three components:
(1) A summary of the auditor's results, which must include:
(i) The type of report the auditor issued (if applicable) on whether the financial statements (if available) audited were prepared in accordance with GAAP ( unmodified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, or disclaimer of opinion);
i.e.,(ii) Where applicable, a statement about whether significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control were disclosed by the audit of the financial statements (if available);
(iii) A statement (if applicable) as to whether the audit disclosed any noncompliance that is material to the financial statements (if available) of the auditee;
(iv) Where applicable, a statement about whether significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control over major programs were disclosed by the audit;
(v) The type of report the auditor issued on compliance ( unmodified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, or disclaimer of opinion);
i.e.,(vi) A statement as to whether the audit disclosed any audit findings that the auditor is required to report under § 910.516 Audit findings, paragraph (a);

(2) Findings relating to the financial Statements (if available) which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.
(3) Findings and questioned costs for DOE awards which must include audit findings as defined in § 910.516 Audit findings, paragraph (a).
(i) Audit findings ( internal control findings, compliance findings, questioned costs, or fraud) that relate to the same issue should be presented as a single audit finding.
e.g.,(ii) Audit findings that relate to both the financial statements (if available) and DOE awards, as reported under paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, respectively, should be reported in both sections of the schedule. However, the reporting in one section of the schedule may be in summary form with a reference to a detailed reporting in the other section of the schedule.
(e) Nothing in this part precludes combining of the audit reporting required by this section with the reporting required by § 910.512 Report submission, paragraph (b), when allowed by GAGAS.
[87 FR 15322, Mar. 18, 2022]


N910.516SECTION1§ 910.516   Audit findings.(a)  The auditor must report the following as audit findings in a schedule of findings and questioned costs:
Audit findings reported.(1) Significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over major programs and significant instances of abuse relating to major programs. The auditor's determination of whether a deficiency in internal control is a significant deficiency or material weakness for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program identified in the Compliance Supplement.
(2) Material noncompliance with the provisions of Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of DOE awards related to a major program. The auditor's determination of whether a noncompliance with the provisions of Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of DOE awards is material for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program identified in the compliance supplement.
(3) Known questioned costs that are greater than $25,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program. Known questioned costs are those specifically identified by the auditor. In evaluating the effect of questioned costs on the opinion on compliance, the auditor considers the best estimate of total costs questioned (likely questioned costs), not just the questioned costs specifically identified (known questioned costs). The auditor must also report known questioned costs when likely questioned costs are greater than $25,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program. In reporting questioned costs, the auditor must include information to provide proper perspective for judging the prevalence and consequences of the questioned costs.
(4) Known questioned costs that are greater than $25,000 for a DOE program. which is not audited as a major program. Except for audit follow-up, the auditor is not required under this Part to perform audit procedures for such a DOE program; therefore, the auditor will normally not find questioned costs for a program that is not audited as a major program. However, if the auditor does become aware of questioned costs for a DOE program that is not audited as a major program ( as part of audit follow-up or other audit procedures) and the known questioned costs are greater than $25,000, then the auditor must report this as an audit finding.
e.g.,(5) Not applicable.
(6) Known or likely fraud affecting a DOE award, unless such fraud is otherwise reported as an audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs for DOE awards. This paragraph does not require the auditor to report publicly information which could compromise investigative or legal proceedings or to make an additional reporting when the auditor confirms that the fraud was reported outside the auditor's reports under the direct reporting requirements of GAGAS.
(7) Instances where the results of audit follow-up procedures disclosed that the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with § 910.511 Audit findings follow-up, paragraph (b) materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding.
(b)  Audit findings must be presented in sufficient detail and clarity for the auditee to prepare a corrective action plan and take corrective action, and for DOE to arrive at a management decision. The following specific information must be included, as applicable, in audit findings:
Audit finding detail and clarity.(1) Federal program and specific Federal award identification including the CFDA title and number, and Federal award identification number and year. When information, such as the CFDA title and number or DOE award identification number, is not available, the auditor must provide the best information available to describe the Federal award.
(2) The criteria or specific requirement upon which the audit finding is based, including the Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the DOE awards. Criteria generally identify the required or desired state or expectation with respect to the program or operation. Criteria provide a context for evaluating evidence and understanding findings.
(3) The condition found, including facts that support the deficiency identified in the audit finding.
(4) A statement of cause that identifies the reason or explanation for the condition or the factors responsible for the difference between the situation that exists (condition) and the required or desired state (criteria), which may also serve as a basis for recommendations for corrective action.
(5) The possible asserted effect to provide sufficient information to the auditee and DOE to permit them to determine the cause and effect to facilitate prompt and proper corrective action. A statement of the effect or potential effect should provide a clear, logical link to establish the impact or potential impact of the difference between the condition and the criteria.
(6) Identification of questioned costs and how they were computed. Known questioned costs must be identified by applicable CFDA number(s) and applicable DOE award identification number(s).
(7) Information to provide proper perspective for judging the prevalence and consequences of the audit findings, such as whether the audit findings represent an isolated instance or a systemic problem. Where appropriate, instances identified must be related to the universe and the number of cases examined and be quantified in terms of dollar value. The auditor should report whether the sampling was a statistically valid sample.
(8) Identification of whether the audit finding was a repeat of a finding in the immediately prior audit and if so any applicable prior year audit finding numbers.
(9) Recommendations to prevent future occurrences of the deficiency identified in the audit finding.
(10) Views of responsible officials of the auditee.
(c)  Each audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs must include a reference number in the format meeting the requirements of the data collection form submission required by § 910.512 Report submission, paragraph (b) to allow for easy referencing of the audit findings during follow-up.


Reference numbers.910.517SECTION1§ 910.517   Audit documentation.(a)  The auditor must retain audit documentation and reports for a minimum of three years after the date of issuance of the auditor's report(s) to the auditee, unless the auditor is notified in writing by DOE or the cognizant agency for indirect costs to extend the retention period. When the auditor is aware that the Federal agency or auditee is contesting an audit finding, the auditor must contact the parties contesting the audit finding for guidance prior to destruction of the audit documentation and reports.
Retention of audit documentation.(b)  Audit documentation must be made available upon request to the cognizant agency for indirect cost, DOE, or GAO at the completion of the audit, as part of a quality review, to resolve audit findings, or to carry out oversight responsibilities consistent with the purposes of this Part. Access to audit documentation includes the right of Federal agencies to obtain copies of audit documentation, as is reasonable and necessary.


Access to audit documentation.910.518SECTION1§ 910.518   [Reserved]910.519SECTION1§ 910.519   Criteria for Federal program risk.(a)  The auditor's determination should be based on an overall evaluation of the risk of noncompliance occurring that could be material to the DOE program. The auditor must consider criteria, such as described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, to identify risk in Federal programs. Also, as part of the risk analysis, the auditor may wish to discuss a particular DOE program with auditee management and DOE.
General.(b)  (1) Weaknesses in internal control over DOE programs would indicate higher risk. Consideration should be given to the control environment over DOE programs and such factors as the expectation of management's adherence to Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of DOE awards and the competence and experience of personnel who administer the DOE programs.
Current and prior audit experience.(i) A DOE program administered under multiple internal control structures may have higher risk. The auditor must consider whether weaknesses are isolated in a single operating unit ( one college campus) or pervasive throughout the entity.
e.g.,(ii) When significant parts of a DOE program are passed through to subrecipients, a weak system for monitoring subrecipients would indicate higher risk.
(2) Prior audit findings would indicate higher risk, particularly when the situations identified in the audit findings could have a significant impact on a DOE program or have not been corrected.
(3) DOE programs not recently audited as major programs may be of higher risk than Federal programs recently audited as major programs without audit findings.
(c)  (1) Oversight exercised by DOE could be used to assess risk. For example, recent monitoring or other reviews performed by an oversight entity that disclosed no significant problems would indicate lower risk, whereas monitoring that disclosed significant problems would indicate higher risk.
Oversight exercised by DOE.(2) Federal agencies, with the concurrence of OMB, may identify Federal programs that are higher risk. OMB will provide this identification in the compliance supplement.
(d)  (1) The nature of a Federal program may indicate risk. Consideration should be given to the complexity of the program and the extent to which the Federal program contracts for goods and services. For example, Federal programs that disburse funds through third party contracts or have eligibility criteria may be of higher risk. Federal programs primarily involving staff payroll costs may have high risk for noncompliance with requirements of 2 CFR 200.430 Compensation—personal services, but otherwise be at low risk.
Inherent risk of the Federal program.(2) The phase of a Federal program in its life cycle at the Federal agency may indicate risk. For example, a new Federal program with new or interim regulations may have higher risk than an established program with time-tested regulations. Also, significant changes in Federal programs, statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of Federal awards may increase risk.
(3) The phase of a Federal program in its life cycle at the auditee may indicate risk. For example, during the first and last years that an auditee participates in a Federal program, the risk may be higher due to start-up or closeout of program activities and staff.
(4) Programs with larger Federal awards expended would be of higher risk than programs with substantially smaller Federal awards expended.

N910.520SECTION1§ 910.520   Criteria for a low-risk auditee.An auditee that meets all of the following conditions for each of the preceding two audit periods may qualify as a low-risk auditee and be eligible for reduced audit coverage.
(a) Compliance audits were performed on an annual basis in accordance with the provisions of this Subpart, including submitting the data collection form to DOE within the timeframe specified in § 910.512 Report submission. A for-profit entity that has biennial audits does not qualify as a low-risk auditee.
(b) The auditor's opinion on whether the financial statements (if available) were prepared in accordance with GAAP, or a basis of accounting required by state law, and the auditor's in relation to opinion on the schedule of expenditures of DOE awards were unmodified.
(c) There were no deficiencies in internal control which were identified as material weaknesses under the requirements of GAGAS.
(d) The auditor did not report a substantial doubt about the auditee's ability to continue as a going concern.
(e) None of the DOE programs had audit findings from any of the following in either of the preceding two audit periods:
(1) Internal control deficiencies that were identified as material weaknesses in the auditor's report on internal control as required under § 910.515 Audit reporting, paragraph (c);
(2) Not applicable.
(3) Not applicable.

NECFR4d9a3e180c604a2SUBJGRPManagement Decisions910.521SECTION1§ 910.521   Management decision.(a)  The management decision must clearly state whether or not the audit finding is sustained, the reasons for the decision, and the expected auditee action to repay disallowed costs, make financial adjustments, or take other action. If the auditee has not completed corrective action, a timetable for follow-up should be given. Prior to issuing the management decision, the Federal agency may request additional information or documentation from the auditee, including a request for auditor assurance related to the documentation, as a way of mitigating disallowed costs. The management decision should describe any appeal process available to the auditee. While not required, DOE agency may also issue a management decision on findings relating to the financial statements (if they were available) which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.
General.(b) As provided in § 910.513 Responsibilities, paragraph (c)(3), DOE is responsible for issuing a management decision for findings that relate to DOE awards it makes to for-profit entities.
(c) Not applicable.
(d)  DOE must issue a management decision within six months of acceptance of the audit report. The auditee must initiate and proceed with corrective action as rapidly as possible and corrective action should begin no later than upon receipt of the audit report.
Time requirements.(e)  Management decisions must include the reference numbers the auditor assigned to each audit finding in accordance with § 910.516 Audit findings paragraph (c).

(10) Conform to other provisions of this part, as applicable.
(c) DOE may reduce or eliminate the cost share requirement imposed by 42 U.S.C. 7256(g)(1) where the Agreements Officer (AO), meaning the cognizant warranted DOE or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer other transaction agreements, determines the cost sharing is impracticable in a given case, unless there is a statutory requirement for cost sharing that applies to the particular award. When section 988 of EPAct 2005 applies to an award, the AO must obtain the required approval of the elimination or reduction of the required cost share in accordance with the section 988 of EPAct 2005.




930.130SECTION1§ 930.130   Fee or profit.The Agreements Officer, meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer other transaction (OT) agreements, may not issue an OT agreement if any awardee, subawardees or participant is to receive fee or profit for the research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) efforts. This requirement extends to all awardees and performers funded under the project, including any subawards for substantive program performance, but it does not preclude participants' or subawardees' payment of reasonable fee or profit when making purchases from suppliers of goods ( supplies and equipment) or services needed to carry out the RD&D.




e.g.,930.135SECTION1§ 930.135   Competition.(a) Department of Energy (DOE) awards other transaction (OT) agreements using non-procurement, non-Federal financial assistance competitive processes in a merit-based selection process:
(1) In every case where required by statute; and
(2) To the maximum extent feasible, in all other cases. If it is not feasible to use competitive process, the reason for not using a competitive process must be documented by the Agreements Officer (AO), meaning the cognizant warranted DOE or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer OT agreements.
(b) The AO must document any restrictions on awardee eligibility.




930.140SECTION1§ 930.140   Disclosure of information.(a) For all other transaction (OT) agreements, trade secrets and commercial or financial information that would be protected from disclosure requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (codified at 5 U.S.C. 552) if obtained from a person other than a Federal agency:
(1) For a period of five years after the date on which the information is developed; or
(2) For up to thirty years after the date on which the information is developed, if the Secretary or delegee of the Secretary determines that the nature of the technology under the transaction, including nuclear technology, could reasonably require an extended period of protection from disclosure to reach commercialization.
(b) As provided in 42 U.S.C. 7256(g)(1) incorporating certain provisions of 10 U.S.C. 4021, disclosure is not required, and may not be compelled, under FOIA during that period if:

(2) The type of information is among the following types that are exempt:
(i) Proposals, proposal abstracts, and supporting documents; and
(ii) Business plans and technical information submitted on a confidential basis.
(c) If proposers desire to protect business plans and technical information for five years from FOIA disclosure requirements, they must mark them with a legend identifying them as documents submitted on a confidential basis. After the five-year period, information may be protected for longer periods if it meets any of the criteria in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) (as implemented by the DOE in 10 CFR part 1004) for exemption from FOIA disclosure requirements.


BSUBPARTSubpart B—Pre-Award Business Evaluation930.200SECTION1§ 930.200   Scope.This subpart addresses administrative matters that do not impose organization-wide requirements on an awardee's business (financial management, property management, or purchasing) systems. An organization does not have to redesign its business systems to accommodate variations in these requirements. Agreements may differ in the requirements that they specify based on the awardee and the specific circumstances of the research, development, and demonstration project.




930.205SECTION1§ 930.205   Financial management standards.(a) Any awardees that currently perform under other expenditure-based Federal procurement contracts or assistance awards are subject to the same standards for financial management systems that apply to those other Federal awards.
(b) Any awardees that do not currently perform under expenditure-based Federal procurement contracts or assistance awards should be allowed to use their existing financial management system as long as the system, at a minimum, effectively controls all project funds, including Federal funds and any required cost share. The system must have complete, accurate, and current records that document the sources of funds and the purposes for which they are disbursed. Awardees also must have procedures for ensuring that project funds are used only for purposes permitted by the agreement.




930.210SECTION1§ 930.210   Cost principles and standards.(a)  The cost principles in 48 CFR part 31 will generally apply to for-profit awardees.
For-profit awardees.(b)  The cost principles in 2 CFR part 200 will generally apply to states, local governments, Indian Tribes, institutes of higher education and other nonprofit entities.
Other than For-profit awardees.(c)  The Agreements Officer, meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy (DOE) or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer other transaction agreements, may establish alternative standards in the agreement as long as that alternative provides, as a minimum, that:
Cost standards.(1) Federal funds and funds counted as awardees' cost sharing will be used only for costs that a reasonable and prudent person would incur in carrying out the research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) project contemplated by the agreement.
(2) Costs must be allocated to DOE and other projects in accordance with the relative benefits the projects receive.
(3) Costs allocated to DOE projects must be given consistent treatment with costs allocated to the participants' other RD&D activities ( activities supported by the participants themselves or by non-Federal sponsors).
e.g.,(4) The standards must also state that the Federal funds and funds counted as participants' cost sharing will be used only for costs that are consistent with the purposes stated in the governing Congressional authorizations and appropriations.




930.215SECTION1§ 930.215   Audit requirements.(a)  If an expenditure-based other transaction (OT) agreement provides for audits of a for-profit participant, the Agreements Officer, meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer OT agreements, also must specify:
For-profit awardees.(1) Whether the Defense Contract Auditing Agency or an Independent Public Accountant will perform the required audits.
(2) What the audits are to cover.
(3) Who will pay for the audits.
(4) The auditing standards that the auditor will use.
(5) The available remedies for noncompliance.
(6) Where the auditor is to send audit reports.
(7) The retention period for the auditor's working papers.
(8) Who will have access to the auditor's working papers.
(b)  Expenditure-based OT agreements are subject to the Single Audit Act (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507). State, local government, Indian Tribes, institutes of higher education, and nonprofit participants are subject to the requirements under that Act. Additional information may be found at 2 CFR part 200, subpart F.




Other than For-profit awardees.930.220SECTION1§ 930.220   Real property and equipment.(a) The participant must include the cost of the real property or equipment as part of the proposed cost of the project. The Agreements Officer (AO), meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy (DOE) or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer other transaction (OT) agreements, must approve the use of project funds (Federal or cost share) to purchase real property or equipment. The AO should specify the use, management, vesting of title, and disposition requirements in the award.
(b) The AO may include an alternative property provision where DOE is authorized to grant title to property or equipment acquired under an OT agreement when determined such a grant is appropriate.




930.225SECTION1§ 930.225   Purchasing systems standards.(a) Any awardees that currently perform under other expenditure-based Federal procurement contracts or assistance awards are subject to the same standards for purchasing systems that apply to those other Federal awards.
(b) Any awardees that do not currently perform under expenditure-based Federal procurement contracts or assistance awards should be allowed to use its existing purchasing system as long as the system, at a minimum, is able to flow down the applicable requirements in Federal statutes, Executive orders, or Governmentwide regulations.


CSUBPARTSubpart C—Award Terms Related to Other Administrative Matters930.300SECTION1§ 930.300   Payment methods.Available payment methods include:
(a)  Under this method, participants request reimbursement for costs incurred during a particular time period. The Department of Energy (DOE) reimburses the participant by electronic funds transfer after approval of the request by the Agreements Officer, meaning the cognizant warranted DOE or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer other transaction agreements, or designee. This payment method is used for expenditure-based awards.
Reimbursement.(b)  Under this method, participants request advance payment based upon projections of the cash needs for the project, or for large purchases. Predetermined payment schedules may be used when the timing of the participant's needs to disburse funds can be predicted in advance with sufficient accuracy to ensure the funds are used in accordance with project objectives and schedules.
Advance payments.(c)  Under this method payments made according to a schedule established for the award that is based on accomplishment of predetermined, well-defined, observable, and verifiable measures of technical progress, outcomes, or other payable milestones. A fixed-support award must use this payment method; however, this does not preclude the use of an initial advance payment if there is no alternative to meeting immediate cash needs. Payments based on payable milestones is the preferred method of payment for an expenditure-based award if well-defined outcomes can be identified.




Payments based on payable milestones.930.305SECTION1§ 930.305   Government approval of changes in plans.Department of Energy must approve any changes in project plans that may result in a need for additional Federal funding to be provided to the other transaction agreement.




930.310SECTION1§ 930.310   Pre-award costs.Pre-award costs may be reimbursed only with the specific approval of the Agreements Officer (AO), meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy (DOE) or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer other transaction agreements. All pre-award costs are incurred at the applicant's and/or awardee's risk. DOE is not obligated to reimburse the costs if, for any reason, the applicant does not receive an award, the award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover the costs, or the AO did not provide prior approval for the reimbursement of the pre-award costs.




930.315SECTION1§ 930.315   Negotiating data and patent rights.The Agreements Officer, meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy (DOE) or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer other transaction agreements, must confer with program officials and assigned intellectual property counsel to develop an overall strategy for intellectual property taking into account inventions and data that may result from the project and future needs the Government may have for rights in them. The strategy should address program mission requirements and any special circumstances that would support modification of standard intellectual property provisions, and should include considerations such as the extent of the awardee's contribution to the development of the technology; expected Government or commercial use of the technology; the need to provide equitable treatment among consortium or team members; and the need for DOE to engage non-traditional Government contractors with unique capabilities.




930.320SECTION1§ 930.320   Data rights.(a) For provisions regarding data rights for any awardee entity type, the data rights requirements at 2 CFR 910.362(d), Rights in data-general rule, normally apply when the Government is to be provided with unlimited rights in data and should be used as a starting point for such other transaction (OT) agreements. Here, the “Rights in Data—General” provision in appendix A to subpart D of 10 CFR part 910 typically applies. However, if the awardee is to receive special data protection, the data requirements at 2 CFR 910.362(e), Rights in data—programs covered under special protected data statutes normally apply and should be used as a starting point for such OT agreements. Here, the “Rights in Data—Programs Covered Under Special Protected Data Statutes” provision in appendix A to subpart D of 10 CFR part 910 typically applies. Consistent with 42 U.S.C. 7256(g)(5), data protection can be provided typically for a period of up to 5 years but may be extended up to a total of 30 years in particular circumstances.
(b) However, while maintaining compliance with 42 U.S.C. 7256(g), the Agreements Officer, meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy (DOE) or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer OT agreements, may negotiate data rights requirements that vary from those listed above. Use of or modifications to the standard rights in data provisions must be approved by cognizant DOE intellectual property counsel.




930.325SECTION1§ 930.325   Rights in inventions.(a) When negotiating rights in inventions, the Agreements Officer (AO), meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy (DOE) or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer other transaction (OT) agreements, should negotiate terms that represent an appropriate balance between the Government's interests and the awardee's interests. Bayh-Dole (35 U.S.C. 200-212) patent rights provisions implemented via 37 CFR 401.14 as modified by the DOE ( U.S. Competitiveness provision and Department of Energy Determination of Exceptional Circumstances Under the Bayh-Dole Act to Further Promote Domestic Manufacture of DOE Science and Energy Technologies) should be used as a starting point for all awardee entity types. However, the AO may negotiate rights that vary from those in modified 37 CFR 401.14. For example, Bayh-Dole March-in-Rights found in modified 37 CFR 401.14 and concerning actions that the Government may take to obtain the right to use subject inventions if the awardee fails to take effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject inventions within a reasonable time, may be modified or removed entirely. Use of or modifications to the standard rights provisions must be approved by cognizant DOE intellectual property counsel.
see e.g.,(b) For subawards, the OT should typically indicate that sub-awardees will get title to inventions they make but alternative terms could be included such as those specifying that sub-awardees' invention rights are to be negotiated between awardee and sub-awardee or some other disposition of invention rights.




930.330SECTION1§ 930.330   Research and technology security and U.S. manufacturing and competitiveness requirements.(a)  Consistent with the objective of enhancing national security and United States competitiveness by increasing the public's reliance on United States commercial technology, the Agreements Officer, meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy (DOE) or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer other transaction (OT) agreements, must include provisions in an OT agreement that addresses foreign access to technology developed under the OT agreement. Provisions must be included in an OT that provide, at a minimum, that any transfer of the technology must be consistent with the U.S. export control laws, regulations and the Department of Commerce Export Regulation at Chapter VII, Subchapter C, Title 15 of the CFR (15 CFR parts 730-774), as applicable.
Foreign access to technology.(b)  All DOE research and technology security policies apply to OTs unless the activities being funded are outside the scope of the policies or otherwise exempted from the policies.
DOE research and technology security policies.(c)  Notice should be included in the OT indicating that products embodying any invention or produced through the use of any invention are subject to the U.S. Competitiveness terms outlined in modified 37 CFR 401.14. These terms may not be modified or waived without approval from cognizant DOE intellectual property counsel.




U.S. manufacturing and competitiveness.930.335SECTION1§ 930.335   Record retention requirements.(a) Awardees must keep records related to the agreement for a period of three years after submission of the final financial status report for an expenditure-based award or final program performance report for a fixed-support award, with the following exceptions:
(1) The awardees must keep records longer than three years after submission of the final financial status report if the records relate to an audit, claim, or dispute that begins but does not reach its conclusion within the 3-year period. In that case, the awardees must keep the records until the matter is resolved and final action taken.
(2) Records for any real property or equipment acquired with project funds under the agreement must be kept for three years after final disposition.
(b) [Reserved]




930.340SECTION1§ 930.340   Access to records.(a) The Department of Energy (DOE), through the Agreements Officer (AO), meaning the cognizant warranted DOE or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer other transaction agreements, has an unfettered right of timely access to any documents, papers, or other records of the awardee which are pertinent to the Federal award, in order to inspect and make copies, audits, examinations, excerpts, and/or transcripts. The right also includes timely and reasonable access to the awardee's personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents. The exercise of this authority is at the discretion of the AO.
(b) Inspectors General and the Comptroller General of the United States may have independent legal authority to access to records or personnel related to the Federal award. Consistent with the independent legal authority, recipients should follow the laws and regulations applicable to requests for access to records or personnel from Inspectors General and the Comptroller General of the United States.




930.345SECTION1§ 930.345   Noncompliance and termination requirements.(a)  If an awardee materially fails to comply with the articles or terms and conditions of an agreement, whether stated in a Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, plan, or the notice of award, the Agreements Officer (AO), meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy (DOE) or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer other transaction (OT) agreements, may take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate:
Noncompliance.(1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the awardee or more severe enforcement action by the AO.
(2) Disallow or deny both the use of funds and any applicable cost share for all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance.
(3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award.
(4) Withhold further awards for the project or program.
(5) Apply other remedies that may be legally available.
(b)  The OT agreement must include an article that indicates that the Government may terminate the agreement in whole or in part if the awardee materially fails to comply with the articles or terms and conditions of an agreement, whether stated in a Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, plan, or the notice of award fails to comply with the articles and requirements of the award. An agreement may include an article providing for the termination of the agreement, in whole or in part, by mutual agreement or as negotiated by the parties. In the case of proposed partial termination of the agreement, if the remaining portion of the award will not accomplish the purposes for which the agreement was made, the award may be terminated in its entirety.
Termination.(1) Unless otherwise negotiated, for terminations of an expenditure-based award, DOE's maximum liability is the lesser of:
(i) DOE's share of allowable costs incurred up to the date of termination, or
(ii) The amount of DOE funds obligated to the award.
(2) Unless otherwise negotiated, for terminations of a fixed-support based award, DOE shall pay the awardee for the last fully completed milestone.
(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, if the awardee initiates termination and the award includes milestone payments, the Government has no obligation to pay the awardee beyond the last completed and paid milestone.
(c)  (1) The awardee has the right to appeal to the cognizant Senior Procurement Executive (SPE), as defined by 41 U.S.C. 1702(c), to review only the following actions:
Right to appeal.(i) A DOE determination that the awardee has failed to comply with the applicable requirements of the award;
(ii) Termination of an award, in whole or in part, by DOE;
(iii) The application by DOE of an indirect cost rate; and
(iv) DOE disallowance of costs.
(2) In reviewing appeals authorized under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the SPE is bound by the applicable law, statutes, and rules, including the requirements of this part, and by the articles or terms and conditions of the award.
(3) The decision of the SPE shall be the final decision of DOE.


DSUBPARTSubpart D—Appropriate Use of Technology Investment Agreements930.400SECTION1§ 930.400   Use of Technology Investment Agreements (TIAs).For purposes of this part, a Technology Investment Agreements (TIA) is a special type of other transaction (OT) agreement that is an assistance instrument used to increase involvement of a for-profit entity or segment of a for-profit entity ( a division or other business unit) that does a substantial portion of its business in the commercial marketplace in Department of Energy's (DOE) research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) programs. A TIA requires substantial Federal involvement in the technical or management aspects of the project. The goal for using a TIA is to broaden the technology base available to meet DOE mission requirements and foster within the technology base new relationships and practices to advance the national economic and energy security of the United States, to promote scientific and technological innovation in support of that mission, and to ensure the environmental cleanup of the national nuclear weapons complex. A TIA therefore is designed to reduce barriers to participation in RD&D programs by for-profit entities that deal primarily in the commercial marketplace. A TIA allows Agreements Officers (AO), meaning the cognizant warranted DOE or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer OT agreements, to tailor Government requirements and lower or remove barriers if it can be done with proper stewardship of Federal funds. A TIA may also promote new relationships among performers in the technology base. Collaborations among for-profit entities that deal primarily in the commercial marketplace, firms that regularly perform on the DOE RD&D programs and nonprofit organizations can enhance overall quality and productivity.




e.g.,930.405SECTION1§ 930.405   TIA awardees.(a) A Technology Investment Agreements (TIA) may be awarded to a single entity or multiple entities ( a teaming arrangement) in prime award-subaward relationships.
e.g.,(b) A TIA requires one or more for-profit entities, not acting in their capacity as the contractor operating a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), to be involved either in the:
(1) Performance of the research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) project; or
(2) The commercial application of the results of the RD&D project.
(c)(1) In those cases where there is only a non-profit awardee or a consortium of non-profit entities or non-profit entities and FFRDC contractors (as sub-awardees), if and as authorized, the awardees must have at least a tentative agreement with a specific for-profit entity or entities that plan on being involved in the commercial application of the results.
(2) In consultation with legal counsel, the Agreements Officer, meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer OT agreements, must review the agreement between the parties to ensure that the for-profit entity is committed to being involved in the commercial application of the results.




930.410SECTION1§ 930.410   Purchase of real property and equipment by for-profit firms.Federal funds provided under another transaction (OT) agreement to for-profit entities must not be used to purchase real property or equipment. If the OT agreement requires the purchase of real property or equipment, the for-profit entity must use its own funds that are separate from the research, development, and demonstration project. The Agreements Officer, meaning the cognizant warranted Department of Energy or National Nuclear Security Administration official authorized to execute and administer OT agreements, should allow the for-profit participant to charge to an expenditure-based award or include in the cost estimate for fixed-support award, only depreciation or use charges for the real property or equipment. Note that the for-profit must charge depreciation consistently with its usual accounting practices and policies. Many for-profits treat depreciation as an indirect cost. Any for-profit that usually charges depreciation indirectly for a particular type of property must not charge depreciation for that property as a direct cost to the OT agreement.




930.415SECTION1§ 930.415   Government participation.A Technology Investment Agreements is used to carry out cooperative relationships between the Federal Government and the awardee(s) which require substantial involvement of the Government in the technical and/or management aspects of the research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) project.

Authority:5 U.S.C. 301 and 10 U.S.C. 113.
Source:85 FR 51160, Aug. 19, 2020, unless otherwise noted.


1104.1SECTION1§ 1104.1   Purpose of this part.This part provides an update to the DoD interim implementation of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in 2 CFR part 200. It supersedes the initial interim implementation of that guidance that DoD adopted in 2 CFR part 1103 on December 19, 2014.


1104.100SECTION1§ 1104.100   Award format for DoD Components' grants and cooperative agreements.DoD Components must conform the format of new grants and cooperative agreements to the standard award format specified in part 1120 of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations (DoDGARS) (2 CFR part 1120). The standard format provides locations within the award for:
(a) General terms and conditions, including the administrative and national policy requirements discussed in § 1104.105(a) and (b), respectively.
(b) Any award-specific terms and conditions discussed in § 1104.110.


1104.105SECTION1§ 1104.105   Regulations governing DoD Components' general terms and conditions.(a)  On an interim basis pending completion of the update of the DoDGARs to implement OMB guidance published in 2 CFR part 200, the following regulatory provisions govern the administrative requirements to be included in general terms and conditions of DoD Components' new grants and cooperative agreements:
Administrative requirements.(1) The provisions of parts 1126 through 1138 of the DoDGARs (2 CFR parts 1126 through 1138, which comprise subchapter D of this chapter) govern the administrative requirements to be included in the general terms and conditions of DoD Components' new grants and cooperative agreements awarded to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes.
(2) Part 34 of the DoDGARs (32 CFR part 34) governs the administrative requirements to be included in general terms and conditions of DoD Components' grants and cooperative agreements awarded to for-profit entities.
(b)  Part 1122 of the DoDGARs (2 CFR part 1122) governs the national policy requirements to be included in DoD Components' new grants and cooperative agreements awarded to all types of entities.


National policy requirements.1104.110SECTION1§ 1104.110   Regulations governing DoD Components' award-specific terms and conditions.On an interim basis pending completion of the update of the DoDGARs to implement OMB guidance published in 2 CFR part 200:
(a) The guidance in 2 CFR part 200 governs administrative requirements to be included in any award-specific terms and conditions used to supplement the general terms and conditions of a new grant or cooperative agreement awarded to an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, State, local government, or Indian tribe.
(b) Part 34 of the DoDGARs (32 CFR part 34) governs the administrative requirements to be included in any award-specific terms and conditions of DoD Components' grants and cooperative agreements awarded to for-profit entities.


1104.115SECTION1§ 1104.115   Regulations governing DoD Components' internal procedures.On an interim basis pending completion of the update of the DoDGARs to implement OMB guidance published in 2 CFR part 200, DoD Components' internal pre-award, time-of-award, and post-award procedures will continue to comply with requirements in parts 21 and 22 of the DoDGARs (32 CFR parts 21 and 22) and other applicable Defense Grant and Agreement Regulatory System (DGARS) policies.

1108PART1PART 1108—DEFINITIONS OF TERMS USED IN SUBCHAPTERS A THROUGH F OF THIS CHAPTER
Authority:5 U.S.C. 301 and 10 U.S.C. 113.
Source:85 FR 51230, Aug. 19, 2020, unless otherwise noted.


ASUBPARTSubpart A—General1108.1SECTION1§ 1108.1   Purpose of this part.(a) This part provides:
(1) Definitions of terms used in subchapters A through F of this chapter; and
(2) Background information as context for understanding terms related to assistance and acquisition purposes, legal instruments that DoD Components make at the prime tier, and lower-tier transactions into which recipients and subrecipients enter when carrying out programs at lower tiers under DoD awards.
(b) This part is, for DoD, the regulatory implementation of OMB guidance in subpart A of 2 CFR part 200.


1108.2SECTION1§ 1108.2   Precedence of definitions of terms in national policy requirements.(a)  Some portions of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations (DoDGARs) may use a term in relation to compliance with a national policy requirement in a statute, Executive order, or other source that defines the term differently than it is defined in subpart B of this part. For purposes of that particular national policy requirement, the definition of a term provided by the source of the requirement and any regulation specifically implementing it takes precedence over the definition in subpart B of this part. Using the definition of a term that takes precedence for each national policy requirement is therefore important when determining the applicability and effect of that requirement.
General.(b)  (1) Current portions of the DoDGARs that specifically implement national policy requirements, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, are:
Examples.(i) A Governmentwide regulation currently codified by DoD at 32 CFR part 26, which implements the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 as it applies to grants (41 U.S.C. chapter 81, as amended);
(ii) A Government regulation currently codified by DoD at 32 CFR part 28, which implements restrictions on lobbying in 31 U.S.C. 1352;
(iii) A DoD regulation at part 1125 of this chapter, which implements Governmentwide guidance on nonprocurement debarment and suspension (2 CFR part 180) that has bases both in statute (section 2455 of Public Law 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327) and in Executive orders 12549 and 12689; and
(iv) Part 1122 of this chapter, which provides standard wording of terms and conditions related to a number of national policy requirements.
(2) To illustrate that a term may be defined differently in conjunction with specific national policy requirements than it is in this part, the term “State” is defined differently in the drug-free workplace requirements at 32 CFR part 26, the lobbying restrictions at 32 CFR part 28, and Subpart B of this part.


1108.3SECTION1§ 1108.3   Definitions of terms used in the Governmentwide cost principles or single audit requirements.(a) Some DoDGARs provisions state that DoD Components or recipients must comply with single audit or cost principles requirements in a Governmentwide issuance that contains defined terms and include the requirements by reference to the issuance without restating them.
(b) For any term in one of those issuances, this part includes the definition of the term only if the DoDGARs also use that term directly.
(c) If the DoDGARs only use the term indirectly,  through the DoDGARs' reference to the issuance, then this part will not include a definition and a user of the DoDGARs should consult definitions in the pertinent Governmentwide source, as follows:
i.e.,(1) The Single Audit Act requirements for audits of recipients and subrecipients that are in subpart F of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200;
(2) The Governmentwide cost principles for institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes that are contained in subpart E of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200; and
(3) The cost principles for for-profit entities at Subpart 31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 31, as supplemented by provisions of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement at subpart 231.2 of 48 CFR part 231.


1108.4SECTION1§ 1108.4   Definitions of terms that vary depending on context.DoDGARs definitions of some terms related to types of legal instruments ( “contract”) and purposes for which they are used ( “procurement” or “acquisition”) may vary, depending on the context. Appendix A to this part provides additional information about those terms and their definitions.


e.g.,e.g.,BSUBPARTSubpart B—Definitions1108.10SECTION1§ 1108.10   Acquire. means to:
Acquire(a) When the term is used in connection with a DoD Component action at the prime tier, obtain property or services by purchase, lease, or barter for the direct benefit or use of the United States Government.
(b) When the term is used in connection with a recipient action or a subrecipient action at a tier under a DoD Component's award:
(1) Purchase services;
(2) Obtain property under the award by:
(i) Purchase;
(ii) Construction;
(iii) Fabrication;
(iv) Development;
(v) The recipient's or subrecipient's donation of the property to the project or program under the award to meet a cost-sharing or matching requirement ( including within the entity's share of the award's project costs the value of the remaining life of the property or its fair market value, rather than charging depreciation); or
i.e.,(vi) Otherwise.


1108.15SECTION1§ 1108.15   Acquisition. means the process of acquiring as described in:
Acquisition(a) Paragraph (a) of § 1108.10 when used in connection with DoD Component actions at the prime tier.
(b) Paragraph (b) of § 1108.10 when used in connection with recipient or subrecipient actions at a lower tier under a DoD Component's award.


1108.20SECTION1§ 1108.20   Acquisition cost. means the cost of an asset to a recipient or subrecipient, including the cost to ready the asset for its intended use.
Acquisition cost(a) For example, when used in conjunction with:
(1) The purchase of equipment, the term means the net invoice price of the equipment, including the cost of any modifications, attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make it usable for the purpose for which it is acquired.
(2) Equipment that a recipient or subrecipient constructs or fabricates—or software that it develops—under an award, the term includes, when capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP):
(i) The construction and fabrication costs of that equipment; and
(ii) The development costs of that software.
(b) Ancillary charges, such as taxes, duty, protective in-transit insurance, freight, and installation may be included in, or excluded from, the acquisition cost in accordance with the recipient's or subrecipient's regular accounting practices.


1108.25SECTION1§ 1108.25   Administrative offset. means an action whereby money payable by the United States Government to, or held by the Government for, a recipient is withheld to satisfy a delinquent debt.


Administrative offset1108.30SECTION1§ 1108.30   Advance payment. means a payment that DoD or a recipient or subrecipient makes by any appropriate payment mechanism, including a predetermined payment schedule, before the recipient or subrecipient disburses the funds for project or program purposes.


Advance payment1108.35SECTION1§ 1108.35   Advanced research. means advanced technology development that creates new technology or demonstrates the viability of applying existing technology to new products and processes in a general way. Advanced research is most closely analogous to precompetitive technology development in the commercial sector ( early phases of research and development on which commercial competitors are willing to collaborate, because the work is not so coupled to specific products and processes that the results of the work must be proprietary). It does not include development of military systems and hardware where specific requirements have been defined. It is typically funded in Advanced Technology Development (Budget Activity 3) programs within DoD's Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriations.


Advanced researchi.e.,1108.40SECTION1§ 1108.40   Agreements officer. means a DoD official with the authority to enter into, administer, and/or terminate technology investment agreements.


Agreements officer1108.45SECTION1§ 1108.45   Applied research. means efforts that attempt to determine and exploit the potential of scientific discoveries or improvements in technology, such as new materials, devices, methods and processes. It typically is funded in Applied Research (Budget Activity 2) programs within DoD's Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriations. Applied research often follows basic research but may not be fully distinguishable from the related basic research. The term does not include efforts whose principal aim is the design, development, or testing of specific products, systems or processes to be considered for sale or acquisition, efforts that are within the definition of “development.”


Applied research1108.50SECTION1§ 1108.50   Approved budget. means, in conjunction with a DoD Component award to a recipient, the most recent version of the budget the recipient submitted, and the DoD Component approved (either at the time of the initial award or subsequently), to summarize planned expenditures for the project or program under the award. It includes:
Approved budget(a) All Federal funding made available to the recipient under the award to use for project or program purposes.
(b) Any cost sharing or matching that the recipient is required to provide under the award.
(c) Any options that have been exercised but not any options that have not yet been exercised.


1108.55SECTION1§ 1108.55   Assistance. means the transfer of a thing of value to a recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by a law of the United States (see 31 U.S.C. 6101(3)). Grants, cooperative agreements, and technology investment agreements are examples of legal instruments that DoD Components use to provide assistance.


Assistance1108.60SECTION1§ 1108.60   Award. means a grant, cooperative agreement, technology investment agreement, or other nonprocurement instrument subject to one or more parts of the DoDGARs. Within each part of the regulations, the term includes only the types of instruments subject to that part.


Award1108.65SECTION1§ 1108.65   Award administration office. means a DoD Component office that performs post-award functions related to the administration of grants, cooperative agreements, technology investment agreements, or other nonprocurement instruments subject to one or more parts of the DoDGARs.


Award administration office1108.70SECTION1§ 1108.70   Basic research. means efforts directed toward increasing knowledge and understanding in science and engineering, rather than the practical application of that knowledge and understanding. It typically is funded within Basic Research (Budget Activity 1) programs within DoD's Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriations. For the purposes of the DoDGARs, basic research includes:
Basic research(a) Research-related, science and engineering education and training, including graduate fellowships and research traineeships; and
(b) Research instrumentation and other activities designed to enhance the infrastructure for science and engineering research.


1108.75SECTION1§ 1108.75   Capital asset. means a tangible or intangible asset used in operations having a useful life of more than one year which is capitalized in accordance with GAAP. Capital assets include:
Capital asset(a) Land, buildings (facilities), equipment, and intellectual property (including software) whether acquired by purchase, construction, manufacture, lease-purchase, exchange, or through capital leases; and
(b) Additions, improvements, modifications, replacements, rearrangements, reinstallations, renovations or alterations to capital assets that materially increase their value or useful life (not ordinary repairs and maintenance).


1108.80SECTION1§ 1108.80   Claim. means a written demand or written assertion by one of the parties to an award seeking as a matter of right, the payment of money in a sum certain, the adjustment or interpretation of an award term or condition, or other relief arising under or relating to the award. A routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim. The submission may be converted to a claim by written notice to the grants or agreements officer if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.


Claim1108.85SECTION1§ 1108.85   Cognizant agency for indirect costs. means the Federal agency responsible for reviewing, negotiating, and approving cost allocation plans and indirect cost proposals on behalf of all Federal agencies. The cognizant agency for indirect costs for a particular entity may be different than the cognizant agency for audit. The cognizant agency for indirect costs:
Cognizant agency for indirect costs(a) For an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, State, local government, or Indian tribe is assigned as described in the appendices to 2 CFR part 200. See 2 CFR 200.19 for specific citations to those appendices.
(b) For a for-profit entity, normally will be the agency with the largest dollar amount of pertinent business, as described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation at 48 CFR 42.003.


1108.90SECTION1§ 1108.90   Contract. means a procurement transaction, as that term is defined in this subpart. A contract is a transaction into which a recipient or subrecipient enters. It is therefore distinct from the term “procurement contract,” which is a transaction that a DoD Component awards at the prime tier.


Contract1108.95SECTION1§ 1108.95   Contracting activity. means an activity to which the Head of a DoD Component has delegated broad authority regarding acquisition functions pursuant to 48 CFR 1.601.


Contracting activity1108.100SECTION1§ 1108.100   Contracting officer. means a DoD official with the authority to enter into, administer, and/or terminate procurement contracts and make related determinations and findings.

Contractor1108.110SECTION1§ 1108.110   Cooperative agreement. means a legal instrument which, consistent with 31 U.S.C. 6305, is used to enter into the same kind of relationship as a grant (see definition of “grant” in this subpart), except that substantial involvement is expected between DoD and the recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated by the cooperative agreement. The term does not include “cooperative research and development agreements” as defined in 15 U.S.C. 3710a.


Cooperative agreement1108.115SECTION1§ 1108.115   Co-principal investigator. means any one of a group of individuals whom an organization that is carrying out a research project with DoD support designates as sharing the authority and responsibility for leading and directing the research intellectually and logistically, other than the one among the group identified as the primary contact for scientific, technical, and related budgetary matters (see the definition of “principal investigator”).


Co-principal investigator1108.120SECTION1§ 1108.120   Cost allocation plan. means either a:
Cost allocation plan(a) Central service cost allocation plan, as defined at 2 CFR 200.9 and described in Appendix V to 2 CFR part 200; or
(b) Public assistance cost allocation plan as described in Appendix VI to 2 CFR part 200.


1108.125SECTION1§ 1108.125   Cost sharing or matching. means the portion of project costs not borne by the Federal Government, unless a Federal statute authorizes use of any Federal funds for cost sharing or matching.


Cost sharing or matching1108.128SECTION1§ 1108.128   Cost type award. means an award that a DoD Component makes that provides for the recipient to be paid based on the actual, allowable costs it incurs in carrying out the award.


Cost-type award1108.130SECTION1§ 1108.130   Cost-type contract. means a procurement transaction awarded by a recipient or a subrecipient at any tier under a DoD Component's grant or cooperative agreement that provides for the contractor to be paid on the basis of the actual, allowable costs it incurs (plus any fee or profit for which the contract provides).


Cost-type contract1108.135SECTION1§ 1108.135   Cost-type subaward. means a subaward that:
Cost-type subaward(a) A recipient or subrecipient makes to another entity at the next lower tier; and
(b) Provides for payments to the entity that receives the cost-type subaward based on the actual, allowable costs it incurs in carrying out the subaward.


1108.140SECTION1§ 1108.140   Debarment. means an action taken by a Federal agency debarring official to exclude a person or entity from participating in covered Federal transactions, in accordance with debarment and suspension policies and procedures for:
Debarment(a) Nonprocurement instruments, which are in OMB guidance at 2 CFR part 180, as implemented by the DoD at 2 CFR part 1125; or

1108.145SECTION1§ 1108.145   Debt. means any amount of money or any property owed to a Federal agency by any person, organization, or entity except another United States Federal agency. Debts include any amounts due from insured or guaranteed loans, fees, leases, rents, royalties, services, sales of real or personal property, or overpayments, penalties, damages, interest, fines and forfeitures, and all other claims and similar sources. For the purposes of this chapter, amounts due a non-appropriated fund instrumentality are not debts owed the United States.


Debt1108.150SECTION1§ 1108.150   Delinquent debt. means a debt:
Delinquent debt(a) That the debtor fails to pay by the date specified in the initial written notice from the agency owed the debt, normally within 30 calendar days, unless the debtor makes satisfactory payment arrangements with the agency by that date; and
(b) With respect to which the debtor has elected not to exercise any available appeals or has exhausted all agency appeal processes.


1108.155SECTION1§ 1108.155   Development. means, when used in the context of “research and development,” the systematic use of scientific and technical knowledge in the design, development, testing, or evaluation of potential new products, processes, or services to meet specific performance requirements or objectives. It includes the functions of design engineering, prototyping, and engineering testing. It typically is funded within programs in Budget Activities 4 through 7 of DoD's Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriations.


Development1108.160SECTION1§ 1108.160   Direct costs. means any costs that are identified specifically with a particular final cost objective, such as an award, in accordance with the applicable cost principles.

Working capital advanceAppendix A to Part 1108APPENDIX1Appendix A to Part 1108—Background on Assistance, Acquisition, and Terms for Types of Legal Instruments
I. Purpose of This Appendix
II. Why Definitions of Some Terms Are Context-Dependent
III. Background: Distinguishing Prime-Tier Relationships and Legal Instruments
IV. Background: Distinguishing Types of Recipients' and Subrecipients' Instruments
This appendix provides background intended to clarify some terms:
A. That are used in this chapter to describe either types of legal instruments that DoD Components, recipients, and subrecipients issue, or the purposes for which those types of instruments are used; and
B. For which this part provides definitions that vary depending on the context within which the terms are used.
A. The DoDGARs contain both:
1. Direction to DoD Components concerning their award of grants and cooperative agreements at the prime tier; and
2. Terms and conditions that DoD Components include in their grants and cooperative agreements to specify the Government's and recipients' rights and responsibilities, including post-award requirements with which recipients' actions must comply.
B. In some cases, the same defined term or two closely related terms are used in relation to both DoD Component actions at the prime tier and recipient or subrecipient actions at lower tiers under DoD Components' awards. But a given defined term may have meanings that differ at the two tiers. For example, in part because the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act applies to DoD Component actions at the prime tier but not to recipient or subrecipient actions at lower tiers (see sections III and IV of this appendix):
1. The terms “acquire” and “acquisition” do not have precisely the same meaning in conjunction with actions at the prime and lower tiers.
2. The meaning of the term “procurement contract” used to describe DoD Component prime-tier actions is not precisely the same as the meaning of “procurement transaction” or “contract” used to describe recipient or subrecipient actions at lower tiers.
A. The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. chapter 63) specifies that the type of legal instrument a DoD Component is to use is based on the nature of the relationship between the DoD Component and the recipient.
B. Specifically, except where another statute authorizes DoD to do otherwise, 31 U.S.C. chapter 63 specifies use of:
1. A procurement contract as the legal instrument reflecting a relationship between a DoD Component and a recipient when the principal purpose of the relationship is to acquire property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government.
2. A grant or cooperative agreement as the legal instrument reflecting a relationship between those two parties when the principal purpose of the relationship is to transfer a thing of value to the recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute.
C. The terms “acquisition” and “assistance” are defined in this part to correspond to the principal purposes described in paragraphs III.B.1 and 2 of this section, respectively. Using those terms, paragraphs III.B.1 and B.2 may be restated to say that grants and cooperative agreements are assistance instruments that DoD Components use, as distinct from procurement contracts they use for acquisition.
A. While the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act applies to Federal agencies, it does not govern types of instruments that recipients and subrecipients of any tier use. That statute does not require a recipient or subrecipient to:
1. Consider any instrument it makes at a lower tier under a Federal assistance award to be a grant or cooperative agreement. Therefore, at its option, a recipient or subrecipient may consider all of its lower-tier instruments to be “contracts.”
2. Associate an “assistance” relationship, as that term is defined in this part and used in this chapter, with any lower-tier transaction that it makes.
B. However, the DoDGARs in this chapter do distinguish between two classes of lower-tier transactions that recipients and subrecipients make: Subawards and procurement transactions. The distinction promotes uniformity in requirements for lower-tier transactions under DoD grants and cooperative agreements. It is based on a long-standing distinction in OMB guidance to Federal agencies, currently at 2 CFR part 200, which DoD implements in this chapter.
C. The distinction between a subaward and procurement transaction is based on the primary purpose of that transaction.
1. The transaction is a subaward if a recipient or subrecipient enters into it with another entity at the next lower tier in order to transfer—for performance by that lower-tier entity—a portion of the substantive program for which the DoD grant or cooperative agreement provided financial assistance to the recipient. Because the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act does not apply to the recipient or subrecipient, it may make a subaward as defined in this part using an instrument that it considers a contract.
2. The transaction is a procurement transaction if the recipient or subrecipient enters into it in order to purchase goods or services from the lower-tier entity that the recipient or subrecipient needs to perform its portion of the substantive program supported by the DoD award.

To whom it applies.(1) Sets forth requirements for DoD Components that award grants and cooperative agreements.
(2) Does not impose requirements on recipients of DoD Components' awards.
(b)  This part applies to grants and cooperative agreements, other than technology investment agreements (TIAs), awarded to any type of recipient entity.


To what awards it applies.1120.3SECTION1§ 1120.3   DoD Component implementation.Each DoD Component that awards grants or cooperative agreements must:
(a) Conform the format of its awards to the standard format established by this part no later than [18 months after the effective date of the final rule].
(b) Update electronic systems it maintains for generating awards within 18 months of the issuance of a new or updated DoD form for the award cover pages, in order to implement that form in those systems, unless it has an approved deviation in accordance with § 1120.110.


1120.4SECTION1§ 1120.4   Elements and subelements of the standard award format in relation to the organization of this part.(a) The standard award format has three major elements that are designated as Divisions I through III of the award.
(1) The first major element of the standard award format is comprised of the award cover pages. It is designated as Division I of the award.
(2) The second major element is comprised of any award-specific terms and conditions. That element is designated as Division II of the award.
(3) The last of the three major elements of the standard award format is comprised of the general terms and conditions. That element is designated as Division III of the award. It has four subelements that are designated as Subdivisions A through D of the general terms and conditions.
(i) The first subelement of the general terms and conditions is the preamble, which is designated as Subdivision A.
(ii) The second subelement of the general terms and conditions is comprised of terms and conditions addressing administrative requirements. That subelement is designated as Subdivision B of the general terms and conditions.
(iii) The third subelement of the general terms and conditions is comprised of terms and conditions addressing national policy requirements. That subelement is designated as Subdivision C of the general terms and conditions.
(iv) The last of the four subelements of the general terms and conditions is comprised of any programmatic requirements that apply to awards using those general terms and conditions. That subelement is designated as Subdivision D of the general terms and conditions.
(b) This part has seven subparts. Each subpart addresses one major element or subelement of the standard award format, as shown in Table 1:

It:
(a) Contains basic information about the award or modification and the recipient, as described in § 1120.105;
(b) Is signed by a DoD grants officer; and
(c) Also is signed by the recipient's authorized organizational representative if the award or modification is a bilateral action that is to be signed on behalf of both the DoD Component and recipient.


1120.105SECTION1§ 1120.105   Content of the award cover pages.The award cover pages of each DoD Component grant or cooperative agreement or modification:
(a) Must include, as a minimum, the following information about the award or modification:
(1) The name of the DoD Component awarding office that made the award or modification.
(2) The award number (Federal Award Identification Number or FAIN) and, if the action is a modification, the modification number.
(3) The type of award— grant or cooperative agreement.
i.e.,(4) The type of award action— new award, funding modification, or administrative (non-funding) modification. For an administrative modification, the award cover pages should include a brief description of the purpose of the modification ( a no-cost extension of the end date of the period of performance).
e.g.,e.g.,(5) For a new award or funding modification:
(i) A brief description of the project or program supported by the award.
(ii) The amount of the obligation or deobligation of Federal funds due to the current action and any accompanying change in the total amount of cost sharing or matching required under the award.

i.e.,(iv) The total amount of the project costs in the currently approved budget through the end of the period of performance, the Federal share of that amount, and the non-Federal share even if that share is “zero.”
(v) The total value of the award; the Federal share of that total value (which includes Federal funding obligated to date; future incremental funding actions; and options for which amounts have been predetermined, whether or not they have been exercised yet); and the non-Federal share of that total value ( total cost sharing or matching required under the award).
i.e.,(vi) A table such as the following may be helpful in clearly presenting the information described in paragraphs (a)(5)(ii) through (vi) of this section:
(6) The obligation date ( the date of the grants officer's signature) and, if different, the effective date.
i.e.,(7) The start date and current end date of the period of performance.
(8) The statutory authority or authorities under which the award or modification was made.
(9) The number and title of the program listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under which the award or modification was made.
(10) For a new award (or, as needed, in a modification that amends any of the following information):
(i) Whether the project or program under the award is research and development (R&D). This information is needed by auditors performing single audits of recipients because the OMB guidance to the auditors treats all Federal agencies' R&D programs as a single group (or “cluster”) of programs for audit sampling purposes (see the Single Audit Act requirements implemented in subpart E of 2 CFR part 1128 and FMS Article V in appendix E to part 1128).
(ii) What the award includes in addition to the cover pages— the:
i.e.,(A) Scope of work or other appropriate content to specify the goals and objectives of the project or program supported by the award;
(B) Approved budget; and
(C) General, and any award specific, terms and conditions of the award.
(iii) Where the portions of the award listed in paragraph (a)(10)(ii) of this section are located, which content the DoD Component generally should incorporate into the award by reference. When incorporating that content into the award by reference, the DoD Component must both:
(A) Indicate in the award cover pages that the award incorporates those items into the award by reference, thereby making them an integral part of the award; and
(B) Specify their location (see § 1120.315), rather than transmit them in their entirety with each award.
(iv) The order of precedence in the event of conflict among the general and any award-specific terms and conditions and other potential sources of requirements ( Federal statutes).
e.g.,(v) The name of, and contact information for, the individual or office in the DoD responsible for post-award administration of the award. If there are multiple individuals and offices for different post-award functions ( payments and property administration), the award cover pages should provide information about each.
e.g.,(vi) The name of, and contact information for, the DoD Component's program manager or other point of contact for programmatic matters.
(b) Must include, as a minimum, the following information about the recipient entity:
(1) The recipient's unique entity identifier required for its registration in the System for Award Management (SAM). Currently, that is the Dun and Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number.
(2) The recipient's business name and address, which must be the legal business or “doing business as” name and physical address in SAM at the time of award corresponding to the recipient's unique entity identifier.
(3) The name and title of the recipient's authorized representative, either the individual who signed the application or proposal on behalf of the recipient entity or another individual designated by that entity.
(4) The name of the recipient's Project or Program Director (PD) or Principal Investigator (PI) and his or her organization, if different from the name of the recipient organization. If there are multiple PDs or co-PIs, the name and organization of each should be included.
(5) The indirect cost rate in effect at the start of the performance period for the award, which generally is a Governmentwide rate negotiated by the recipient's cognizant agency for indirect costs. However, this requirement does not apply— the award cover pages need not include the recipient's indirect cost rate—if the recipient entity affirms that it treats its indirect cost rate as proprietary information.
i.e.,(c) May also include, as applicable, elements such as:
(1) A statement that the award can be amended only by a grants officer. The statement might also explain how amendments are issued.
(2) Information about any planned, future incremental funding or options for which amounts were pre-determined.

(1) There is not currently any DoD form for the award cover pages; or
(2) The DoD Component obtains approval for a deviation from the requirement to use a DoD form from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, in accordance with the procedures specified in 32 CFR 21.340.
(b) If a DoD Component does not use a DoD form for its award cover pages, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, its award cover pages must include all information specified in § 1120.105.


BSUBPARTSubpart B—Award-specific Terms and Conditions1120.200SECTION1§ 1120.200   Purpose and inclusion of award-specific terms and conditions.A DoD Component must include with each award, for transmission to the recipient, any terms and conditions needed to communicate requirements specific to the individual award as distinct from the more broadly applicable requirements in the general terms and conditions. For a modification to an award, only changes to previously transmitted terms and conditions must be included.


1120.205SECTION1§ 1120.205   Organization and wording of award-specific terms and conditions.DoD Components should organize and word award-specific terms and conditions to make them as clear and easy to understand as possible for the benefit of recipients, award administrators, auditors, and others who may need to use them. The DoDGARs specify neither a standard organization nor standard wording for award-specific terms and conditions.


CSUBPARTSubpart C—General Terms and Conditions1120.300SECTION1§ 1120.300   Purpose of general terms and conditions.The general terms and conditions comprise the portion of the award with requirements that apply to a class of awards ( awards under a particular program or type of program activity, such as research or education, or for a class of recipients, such as for-profit entities).


e.g.,1120.305SECTION1§ 1120.305   Requirement for general terms and conditions.Each DoD Component must establish at least one set of general terms and conditions. A DoD Component may have more than one set, as it deems appropriate to reflect differences in its award terms and conditions across different programs, classes of recipients, or types of activity.


1120.310SECTION1§ 1120.310   Use of plain language.(a) DoD Components must use plain language in:
(1) General terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes. Those awards are subject to the DoDGARs provisions in:
(i) 2 CFR parts 1128 through 1138, the appendices to which provide standard wording for general terms and conditions addressing administrative requirements. That standard wording uses personal pronouns.
(ii) 2 CFR part 1122, the appendices to which provide standard wording for general terms and conditions addressing commonly applicable national policy requirements. That standard wording also uses personal pronouns.
(2) The national policy requirements in Subdivision B of general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements to for-profit entities, which also are subject to 2 CFR part 1122.
(b) Although the DoDGARs currently do not provide standard wording for terms and conditions addressing administrative requirements for use in awards to for-profit entities, DoD Components are strongly encouraged to use plain language and personal pronouns in their terms and conditions of those other awards. The DoDGARs provisions that specify the administrative requirements to incorporate into those terms and conditions are listed in § 1120.510(b).


1120.315SECTION1§ 1120.315   Availability of general terms and conditions.(a) A DoD Component that issues a funding opportunity announcement under which grants or cooperative agreements may be awarded must maintain on the internet the general terms and conditions for those awards if:
(1) The distribution of the funding opportunity announcement is unlimited; and
(2) The DoD Component anticipates making 10 or more awards per year using those general terms and conditions.
(b) Each DoD Component that maintains a set of general terms and conditions on the internet must also maintain an archive of previous versions of that set at the same internet location, for use by recipients, post-award administrators, auditors, and others. Each version must be labeled with its effective dates.
(c) If a DoD Component has a set of general terms and conditions that is not subject to the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section and the DoD Component chooses not to maintain that set on the internet:
(1) It must tell potential applicants or proposers in the funding opportunity announcement, if there is one, how they may view or obtain a copy of the general terms and conditions; or
(2) If there is no funding opportunity announcement ( if it is a noncompetitive program for which all recipients are known in advance), the DoD Component must provide the general terms and conditions to each recipient no later than the time of award.


e.g.,DSUBPARTSubpart D—Preamble to the General Terms and Conditions1120.400SECTION1§ 1120.400   Requirement to include a preamble.Each DoD Component must include a preamble as Subdivision A of each set of general terms and conditions it maintains, to provide information to help recipients understand how to use those terms and conditions.


1120.405SECTION1§ 1120.405   Content of the preamble.The preamble for each set of general terms and conditions must include at least the following information elements, organized in the order shown:
(a)  This should show the articles within each other subdivision of the general terms and conditions (Subdivisions B and C for administrative and national policy requirements and, if needed, Subdivision D for programmatic requirements).
Table of contents.(b)  This element identifies the programs, types of awards, and types of recipient entities that are subject to the set of general terms and conditions.
Scope.(c)  This is the date on which the particular version of the set of general terms and conditions became effective, which enables a recipient to easily distinguish it from any earlier or subsequent versions. The version date of each article within the general terms and conditions must be indicated in parentheses following the title of the article, to help a recipient identify the articles that changed from previous versions of the general terms and conditions.
Effective date.(d)  The purpose of this element of the preamble is to implement OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.111(b) by informing each recipient that:
English language.(1) It must translate any of the award content (including attachments to it and any material incorporated into the award by reference) into another language to the extent that the recipient's compliance with the award's terms and conditions depends upon a significant number of its employees who are not fluent in English being able to read and comprehend that content.
(2) If it does translate any award content into another language, either as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section or at its own initiative, the original award content in the English language will take precedence in the event of an inconsistency between the award requirements in the English and translated versions.
(e)  This section of the preamble is required when the general terms and conditions use personal pronouns, in accordance with § 1120.310. Its purpose is to inform recipients about the meanings of those personal pronouns.
Plain language.(f)  Providing the definitions of words and phrases that are used in the general terms and conditions and defined in the DoDGARs is more helpful to recipients than referring them to the DoDGARs to find the definitions.


Definitions.ESUBPARTSubpart E—Administrative Requirements Portion of the General Terms and Conditions1120.500SECTION1§ 1120.500   Scope of administrative requirements.The administrative requirements in an award are post-award and after-the-award requirements for recipients in the following subject matter areas:
(a) Financial and program management, to include financial management system standards, payment, allowable costs, program and budget revisions, audits, cost sharing or matching, and program income.
(b) Property administration, to include title vesting, property management system standards, and use and disposition of tangible and intangible property.
(c) Recipient procurement procedures.
(d) Financial, programmatic, property, and other reporting.
(e) Records retention and access, remedies, claims and disputes, and closeout.


1120.505SECTION1§ 1120.505   Location of administrative requirements in the standard award format.As shown in the table in § 1120.4(b), the standard award format includes administrative requirements as Subdivision B of the general terms and conditions.


1120.510SECTION1§ 1120.510   Sources of administrative requirements.The source of administrative requirements is:
(a) Subchapter D of this chapter for cost-type grant and cooperative agreement awards to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes. Subchapter D provides a standard set of articles into which a DoD Component organizes the administrative requirements. It also provides standard wording for the general terms and conditions in those articles, as explained in the overview of subchapter D in 2 CFR part 1126.
(b) 32 CFR part 34 for grant and cooperative agreement awards to for-profit entities. That part of the DoDGARs specifies the administrative requirements for awards to those entities but does not provide standard articles or terms and conditions.


1120.515SECTION1§ 1120.515   Incorporation of administrative requirements into general terms and conditions by reference.(a) For cost-type awards to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes, DoD Components are strongly encouraged to construct the portion of their general terms and conditions addressing administrative requirements by:
(1) Incorporating the standard wording of each article of administrative requirements provided in subchapter D of this chapter (the standard wording of the articles is in the appendices to 2 CFR parts 1128 through 1138) into those general terms and conditions by reference; and
(2) Stating any variations from that standard wording ( any sections or paragraphs that the DoD Component adds, revises, or omits, consistent with the DoDGARs prescription for use of the standard wording).
e.g.,(b) Incorporating that standard wording into general terms and conditions by reference, rather than including the full text of each article of the general terms and conditions, will make it easier for those who must use terms and conditions of multiple DoD Components' awards ( recipients, DoD Components' post-award administrators, and auditors) to quickly identify how each Component's general terms and conditions differ from the DoD standard wording.


e.g.,FSUBPARTSubpart F—National Policy Requirements Portion of the General Terms and Conditions1120.600SECTION1§ 1120.600   Scope of national policy requirements.National policy requirements, as defined in 2 CFR 1122.2, are requirements:
(a) That are prescribed by a statute, Executive order, policy guidance issued by the Executive Office of the President, or regulation that specifically refer to grants, cooperative agreements, or financial assistance in general;
(b) With which a recipient of a grant or cooperative agreement must comply during the period of performance; and
(c) That are outside subject matter areas covered by administrative requirements, as described in § 1120.500.


1120.605SECTION1§ 1120.605   Location of national policy requirements in the standard award format.As shown in the table in § 1120.4(b), the standard award format includes national policy requirements as Subdivision C of the general terms and conditions.


1120.610SECTION1§ 1120.610   Source of national policy requirements.The source of national policy requirements to be included in a grant or cooperative agreement is 2 CFR part 1122.


1120.615SECTION1§ 1120.615   Incorporation of national policy requirements into general terms and conditions by reference.For the same reason given in § 1120.515(b), DoD Components are strongly encouraged to construct the portion of their general terms and conditions addressing national policy requirements for awards to all types of recipient entities, including for-profit entities, by:
(a) Incorporating the standard wording of each article of national policy requirements provided in the appendices to 2 CFR part 1122 into those general terms and conditions by reference; and
(b) Stating any variations from that standard wording ( any added, omitted, or revised paragraphs, based on which national policy requirements apply to programs and recipients for which the general terms and conditions are used).


e.g.,GSUBPARTSubpart G—Programmatic Requirements Portion of the General Terms and Conditions1120.700SECTION1§ 1120.700   Scope of programmatic requirements.A requirement is most appropriately included in the programmatic requirements portion of the general terms and conditions if it:
(a) Is not in one of the subject matter areas covered by the administrative requirements in Subdivision B of the general terms and conditions, as described in § 1120.500.
(b) Does not meet the criteria in § 1120.600 for a national policy requirement.
(c) Broadly applies to awards using the general terms and conditions. Requirements that apply to relatively few of those awards are more appropriately included in the award-specific terms and conditions of the individual awards to which they apply.
(d) Is expected to be in effect for the foreseeable future, rather than for a limited period of time. For example, a requirement in an annual appropriations act that applies specifically to funding made available by that act is better addressed through the award-specific terms and conditions of awards or modifications to which it applies.


1120.705SECTION1§ 1120.705   Location of programmatic requirements in the standard award format.As shown in the table in § 1120.4(b), the standard award format includes programmatic requirements as Subdivision D of the general terms and conditions.


1120.710SECTION1§ 1120.710   Examples of programmatic requirements.Examples of provisions appropriately included as programmatic requirements in Subdivision D of the general terms and conditions include:
(a) Requirements for recipients to acknowledge the DoD Component's support in publications of results of the projects or programs performed under awards.
(b) Requirements for recipients to promptly alert the DoD Component if they develop any information in the course of performing the projects or programs under their awards that, in their judgment, might adversely affect national security if disclosed.
(c) Reservation of the Government's right to use non-Federal personnel in any aspect of post-award administration of awards, with appropriate nondisclosure requirements placed on those personnel to protect sensitive information about recipients or the projects or programs supported by their awards.

ASUBPARTSubpart A—General1122.1SECTION1§ 1122.1   Purpose of this part.(a) This part specifies a standard format and standard wording of general terms and conditions for Subdivision B of the general terms and conditions of DoD grants and cooperative agreements, which concerns national policy requirements.
(b) It thereby implements:
(1) Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in 2 CFR 200.210(b)(ii) and 200.300, as those paragraphs of 2 CFR part 200 relate to national policy requirements for general terms and conditions of DoD grants and cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education and other nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes.
(2) National policy requirements, to the extent they apply, for general terms and conditions of DoD awards to for-profit firms, foreign organizations, and foreign public entities.


1122.2SECTION1§ 1122.2   Definition of “national policy requirement.”For the purposes of this chapter, a national policy requirement is a requirement:
(a) That is prescribed by a statute, Executive order, policy guidance issued by the Executive Office of the President, or regulation that specifically refers to grants, cooperative agreements, or financial assistance in general;
(b) With which a recipient of a grant or cooperative agreement must comply during the period of performance; and
(c) That is outside subject matter areas covered by administrative requirements in subchapters D or E of this chapter.


1122.3SECTION1§ 1122.3   Definition of other terms as they are used in this part.Because the meaning of some terms used in this part derive from their definitions in the statutes, Executive orders, or other sources of national policy requirements that this part implements, the meanings of those terms may vary from their meanings in other parts of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations. For example, some statutes define “State in ways that differ from each other and from the definition provided in 2 CFR part B. In each case, the definition in the source of the pertinent national policy requirement takes precedence over the definition in 2 CFR part B for the purposes of complying with that requirement.


”BSUBPARTSubpart B—Terms and Conditions1122.100SECTION1§ 1122.100   Purpose of this subpart.This subpart provides:
(a) Direction to DoD Components on how to construct the four articles of national policy requirements for inclusion in the general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements.
(b) Standard wording for national policy requirements that are more commonly applicable to DoD Components' grants and cooperative agreements.


1122.105SECTION1§ 1122.105   Where to find the terms and conditions.(a) Appendices A through D of this part provide standard wording of terms and conditions for the four articles of national policy requirements. The articles address the rights and responsibilities of the Government and the recipient related to those national policy requirements.
(b) The following table shows which national policy terms and conditions may be found in each appendix to this part:

(a) Section A of each article includes national policy requirements that are cross-cutting in that their applicability extends to many or all DoD awards. Appendices A through D to this part provide standard wording for each of those requirements.
(b) Section B of each article is the location in the award for program-specific national policy requirements. Section B is reserved in the standard wording of the articles provided in appendices A through D to this part.


1122.115SECTION1§ 1122.115   Cross-cutting national policy requirements.(a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the standard wording provided in appendices A through D to this part for each national policy requirement addressed in Section A of NP Articles I, II, III, and IV, respectively, that may apply either to:
General requirement to include applicable cross-cutting requirements.(1) A recipient of an award using those general terms and conditions; or
(2) A subrecipient of a subaward under an award using those general terms and conditions.
(b)  A DoD Component may reserve or omit any paragraph appendices A through D to this part provide for Section A of NP Articles I, II, III, and IV of its general terms and conditions if it determines that the national policy requirement addressed in that paragraph will not apply to any awards using those terms and conditions nor to any subawards under them.
Authority to reserve or omit inapplicable paragraphs.(c)  (1) A DoD Component may use different wording for a national policy requirement than is provided in appendices A through D to this part if it is authorized or required to do so by a statute or a regulation published in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment.
Authority to use alternate wording.(2) A DoD Component in that case:
(i) Must include the wording required by the statute or regulation in Section B of the appropriate article. This will help a recipient recognize the wording as a variation of the usual DoD wording for the requirement.
(ii) May either reserve the paragraph of Section A of the article in which that national policy requirement otherwise would appear or insert in that paragraph wording to refer the recipient to the paragraph in Section B of the article in which the requirement does appear.


1122.120SECTION1§ 1122.120   Other national policy requirements.If a DoD Component determines that awards using its general terms and conditions, or subawards under them, are subject to a national policy requirement that is not addressed in the standard wording appendices A through D to this part provide for cross-cutting requirements, the DoD Component must include the requirement in its general terms and conditions. It should add the requirement in Section B of NP Article I, II, III, or IV, as most appropriate to the subject matter of the requirement.






Appendix A to Part 1122APPENDIX1Appendix A to Part 1122—Terms and Conditions for NP Article I, “Nondiscrimination National Policy Requirements”

Approval to perform HSR under this award is received after the HRPO has performed a review of your documentation of planned HSR activities and has officially furnished a concurrence with your determination as presented in the documentation.
c. In order for the HRPO to accomplish this concurrence review, you must provide sufficient documentation to enable his or her assessment as follows:
i. If the HSR meets an exemption criterion under 32 CFR 219.101(b), the documentation must include a citation of the exemption category under 32 CFR 219.101(b) and a rationale statement.
ii. If your activity is determined as “non-exempt research involving human subjects”, the documentation must include:
(A) Assurance of Compliance ( Department of Health and Human Services Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) Federalwide Assurance (FWA)) appropriate for the scope of work or program plan; and
i.e.,(B) Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, as well as all documentation reviewed by the IRB to make their determination.
d. The HRPO retains final judgment on what activities constitute HSR, whether an exempt category applies, whether the risk determination is appropriate, and whether the planned HSR activities comply with the requirements in paragraph 1.a of this section.
e. You must notify the HRPO immediately of any suspensions or terminations of the Assurance of Compliance.
f. DoD staff, consultants, and advisory groups may independently review and inspect your research and research procedures involving human subjects and, based on such findings, DoD may prohibit research that presents unacceptable hazards or otherwise fails to comply with DoD requirements.
g. Definitions for terms used in paragraph 1 of this article are found in DoDI 3216.02.

1126.1SECTION1§ 1126.1   Purposes of this subchapter.This subchapter of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations:
(a) Addresses general terms and conditions governing administrative requirements for use by DoD Components when awarding cost-type grants and cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes. It does so by providing:
(1) A standard organization of the administrative requirements into articles of general terms and conditions, each of which is in a specific subject area.
(2) Standard wording for those articles; and
(3) Associated prescriptions for DoD Component's use of the standard wording to construct their general terms and conditions, which allow for adding, omitting, or varying in other ways from the standard wording in certain situations.
(b) Thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200 as it relates to general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes.


1126.2SECTION1§ 1126.2   Applicability of this subchapter.(a)  This subchapter:
Entities.(1) Applies to DoD Components that award cost-type grants and cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes.
(2) Does not directly impose requirements on a recipient of a DoD Component's award but does do so indirectly, through the DoD Component's compliance with this subchapter when it constructs its general award terms and conditions. The terms and conditions delineate the rights and responsibilities of the recipient and the Federal Government under the award.
(b)  This subchapter applies to DoD Components' cost-type grants and cooperative agreements to types of entities identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, other than Technology Investment Agreements that are addressed in 32 CFR part 37.


Awards.1126.3SECTION1§ 1126.3   Exceptions from requirements in this subchapter.(a)  A DoD Component may not grant any exception to the requirements in this subchapter if the exception is:
Exceptions that are not permitted.(1) Prohibited by statute, executive order, or regulation;
(2) Inconsistent with the OMB implementation of the Single Audit Act in Subpart F of 2 CFR part 200.
(b)  Other exceptions are permitted from requirements in this subchapter for institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, States, local governments, and Indian tribes as follows:
Other exceptions.(1)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may incorporate a requirement that is inconsistent with the requirements in this subchapter if that requirement is specifically authorized or required by a statute or regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment.
Statutory or regulatory exceptions.(2)  The Head of the DoD Component or his or her designee may approve an individual exception affecting only one award in accordance with procedures stated in 32 CFR 21.340.
Individual exceptions.(3)  A DoD Component's terms and conditions for small awards may apply less restrictive requirements than those specified in this subchapter (a small award is an award for which the total value of obligated funding through the life of the award is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold).
Small awards.(4)  The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering or his or her designee may approve any class exception affecting multiple awards other than small awards, with OMB concurrence if the class exception is for a requirement that is inconsistent with OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200. Procedures for DoD Components' requests for class exceptions are stated in 32 CFR 21.340.


Other class exceptions.1126.4SECTION1§ 1126.4   Relationship to other portions of the DoD grant and agreement regulations.The administrative requirements specified in this subchapter complement:
(a) Provisions of 32 CFR part 34 that address administrative requirements for DoD Components' grants and cooperative agreements to for-profit entities; and

1126.6   Organization of the other parts of this subchapter.(a) Each of parts 1128 through 1138 of this subchapter is organized into subparts and appendices.
(1) Each appendix provides the standard wording of general terms and conditions for one of the articles of general terms and conditions that the part addresses.
(2) For each appendix addressing a particular article, the part has an associated subpart that provides the prescription for DoD Components' use of the standard wording for that article.
(b) For example, Table 1 to § 1126.5 indicates that 2 CFR part 1128 provides the standard wording of general terms and conditions for FMS Articles I through VII and the prescriptions for DoD Components' use of that standard wording.
(1) FMS Article I on financial management system standards is the first of the articles that 2 CFR part 1128 covers. Appendix A to 2 CFR part 1128 provides the standard wording of general terms and conditions for FMS Article I. The associated subpart of 2 CFR part 1128, subpart A, provides the prescription for DoD Components' use of the standard wording of that article.
(2) Appendices B through G of 2 CFR part 1128 provide the standard wording of general terms and conditions for FMS Articles II through VII, respectively. The associated subparts, Subparts B through G, provide the corresponding prescriptions for DoD Components.

Authority:5 U.S.C. 301 and 10 U.S.C. 113.


Source:85 FR 51171, Aug. 19, 2020, unless otherwise noted.


1128.1SECTION1§ 1128.1   Purpose of this part.(a) This part specifies standard wording of general terms and conditions concerning financial and program management, including recipients' financial management systems, payments, cost sharing or matching, program income, budget and program revisions, audits, allowable costs, and periods of availability of funds.
(b) It thereby implements OMB guidance in the following portions of 2 CFR part 200, as they apply to general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements:
(1) Sections 200.80, 200.209, and 200.302 through 200.309;
(2) Sections 200.301 and 200.328, as they relate to associations between financial data and performance accomplishments and reporting; and
(3) Subparts E and F.


1128.2SECTION1§ 1128.2   Applicability of this part.The types of awards and entities to which this part and other parts in this subchapter apply are described in the subchapter overview at 2 CFR 1126.2.


1128.3SECTION1§ 1128.3   Exceptions from requirements of this part.Exceptions are permitted from the administrative requirements in this part only as described at 2 CFR 1126.3.


1128.4SECTION1§ 1128.4   Organization of this part.(a) The content of this part is organized into subparts and associated appendices.
(1) Each subpart provides direction to DoD Components on how to construct one article of general terms and conditions for grants and cooperative agreements.
(2) For each subpart, there is a corresponding appendix with standard wording for terms and conditions of the article addressed by the subpart. Terms and conditions address rights and responsibilities of the Federal Government and recipients.
(b) A DoD Component must use the wording provided in each appendix in accordance with the direction in the corresponding subpart. That direction may permit DoD Components to vary from the standard wording in some situations.
(c) Table 1 shows which article of general terms and conditions may be found in each of appendices A through G to this part (with the associated direction to DoD Components in Subparts A through G, respectively):

It thereby implements OMB guidance in:
(a) 2 CFR 200.302, 200.303, and 200.328; and
(b) 2 CFR 200.301 and 200.328, as they relate to associations between financial data and performance accomplishments and reporting.


1128.105SECTION1§ 1128.105   Content of FMS Article I.(a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address requirements for recipients' financial management systems.
Requirement.(b) —(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix A to this part provides for FMS Article I.
Award terms and conditionsGeneral.(2)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may:
Exceptions.(i) Reserve Section A of FMS Article I if the DoD Component determines that it is not possible that any States will receive:
(A) DoD Component awards using those general terms and conditions; or
(B) Subawards from recipients of DoD Component awards using those general terms and conditions.
(ii) Reserve paragraph B.6 of FMS Article I if the DoD Component determines that it will not require recipients of awards using those general terms and conditions to relate financial data to performance accomplishments ( through unit costs). Because the nature of research makes the use of unit costs and other relationships between financial data and performance accomplishments generally inappropriate, DoD Components should reserve paragraph B.6 in general terms and conditions for awards supporting research.


e.g.,BSUBPARTSubpart B—Payments (FMS Article II)1128.200SECTION1§ 1128.200   Purpose of FMS Article II.FMS Article II contains requirements related to payments under an award. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.305.


1128.205SECTION1§ 1128.205   Content of FMS Article II.(a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address payment method; payment timing and amounts, which relate to cash management; frequency of payment requests; and matters related to recipients' depositories, including interest earned on advance payments.
Requirement.(b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix B to this part provides for FMS Article II with appropriate additions, deletions, and substitutions as described in §§ 1128.210 through 1128.220.


Award terms and conditions.1128.210SECTION1§ 1128.210   Payment requirements for States.(a)  Payments to States are subject to requirements in Department of the Treasury regulations at 31 CFR part 205 that implement the Cash Management Improvement Act. Those regulations are in two subparts with distinct requirements that apply to different programs:
Policy.(1) Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205 contains requirements for payments to States under “major programs,” as defined in that part. The Department of the Treasury negotiates Treasury-State agreements for major programs. Those agreements specify the appropriate timing and amounts of payments. They further specify a State's interest liability if it receives an advance payment too many days before it disburses the funds for program purposes, as well as the Federal Government's interest liability if it reimburses the State too many days after the State disburses the funds. Most DoD awards to States are not under major programs, so Subpart A applies relatively infrequently.
(2) Subpart B of 31 CFR part 205 applies to all other DoD grants and cooperative agreements to States— awards that are not under major programs.
i.e.,(b) —(1)  Because few DoD awards to States are under major programs, appendix B to this part includes wording for Section A of FMS Article II that specifies the requirements of Subpart B of 31 CFR part 205. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include this wording for Section A of FMS Article II if no award using those terms and conditions will be made to a State under a program designated as a major program in the applicable Treasury-State agreement.
Award terms and conditionsGeneral.(2)  If a DoD Component is establishing general terms and conditions that will be used for awards to States, only some of which are subject to requirements for major programs in Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205, then the DoD Component should:
Exception for awards under major programs.(i) Use appendix B's wording for Section A of FMS Article II in its general terms and conditions; and
(ii) In each award subject to Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205, include award-specific terms and conditions that make payments to the recipient subject to the requirements in Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205 and the applicable Treasury-State agreement, thereby overriding the wording of Section A of FMS Article II.


1128.215SECTION1§ 1128.215   Payment requirements for institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, local governments, and Indian tribes.(a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.305 addresses the use of three payment methods for grants and cooperative agreements—advance payments, reimbursement, and working capital advances. Two of the methods pertain to a DoD Component's general terms and conditions, as described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
Policy.(1)  With the possible exception of construction awards, as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must authorize each recipient to request payments in advance as long as the recipient maintains, or demonstrates the willingness to maintain, both:
Advance payments.(i) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between its receipt of funds from the Federal Government and its disbursement of the funds for project or program purposes; and
(ii) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability specified in the wording of FMS Article I (see Subpart A and appendix A to this part).
(2)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may specify the reimbursement method if the awards using those terms and conditions will support construction projects financed in whole or in part by the Federal Government.
Reimbursement.(b) —(1)  Appendix B provides wording for Section B of FMS Article II that a DoD Component:
Award terms and conditionsGeneral.(i) Must use in general terms and conditions for non-construction awards to authorize recipients to request advance payments; and
(ii) May use in general terms and conditions for construction awards if it elects to authorize recipients of those awards to request advance payments.
(2)  A DoD Component may develop an alternative to appendix B's wording for Section B of FMS Article II to use in general terms and conditions for construction awards, if it elects to specify reimbursement as the payment method for those awards. The alternative:
Alternative award terms and conditions.(i) Would replace appendix B's wording for paragraph B.1 with wording to specify the reimbursement method of payment;
(ii) Must include appendix B's wording for paragraphs B.2.b and c, B.4, and B.5, which may be renumbered as appropriate, because those paragraphs apply to reimbursements as well as advance payments;
(iii) Should omit appendix B's wording for paragraphs B.2.a, B.3, and B.6 because those paragraphs apply specifically to advance payments; and
(iv) Must inform recipients that the DoD payment office generally makes payment within 30 calendar days after receipt of the request for reimbursement by the award administration office, unless the request is reasonably believed to be improper.


1128.220SECTION1§ 1128.220   Electronic funds transfer and other payment procedural instructions or information.(a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that payments will be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT) unless a recipient is excepted in accordance with Department of the Treasury regulations at 31 CFR part 208 from the Governmentwide requirement to use EFT.
Policy.(b) —(1)  Appendix B provides wording for Section C of FMS Article II that a DoD Component must use to specify payment by EFT, when awards are not excepted from the Governmentwide requirement.
Award terms and conditionsElectronic funds transfer.(2)  A DoD Component may insert one or more paragraphs in its general terms and conditions in lieu of the reserved paragraph C.2 in appendix B, to provide procedural instructions or information regarding payments that is common to awards using those terms and conditions. For example, it may insert wording to give detailed instructions on where and how recipients are to submit payment requests. All forms, formats, and data elements for payment requests must be OMB-approved information collections.


Other payment procedures or instructions.CSUBPARTSubpart C—Allowable Costs, Period of Availability of Funds, and Fee or Profit (FMS Article III)1128.300SECTION1§ 1128.300   Purpose of FMS Article III.FMS Article III of the general terms and conditions specifies what costs are allowable as charges to awards and when they are allowable. It also specifies restrictions on payment of fee or profit. It thereby implements OMB guidance in §§ 200.209 and 200.309 and Subpart E of 2 CFR part 200. It also partially implements 2 CFR 200.201(b)(1) and 200.323(c), as those sections apply to the cost principles to be used in relation to subawards and contracts, respectively.


1128.305SECTION1§ 1128.305   Content of FMS Article III.(a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address allowability of costs and permissibility of fee or profit.
Requirement.(b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix C to this part provides for FMS Article III with appropriate reservations as described in §§ 1128.310 through 1128.325.


Award terms and conditions.1128.310SECTION1§ 1128.310   Cost principles.(a)  The set of Governmentwide cost principles applicable to a particular entity type governs the allowability of costs that may be:
Policy.(1) Charged to each cost-type:
(i) DoD grant or cooperative agreement to a recipient of that entity type;
(ii) Subaward to a subrecipient of that entity type at any tier below a DoD grant or cooperative agreement; and
(iii) Procurement transaction with a contractor of that entity type awarded by a recipient of a DoD grant or cooperative agreement or a subrecipient that received a subaward at any tier below that grant or cooperative agreement.
(2) Considered in establishing the amount of any:
(i) Fixed-amount subaward, at any tier under a grant or cooperative agreement, to a subrecipient of that entity type; or
(ii) Fixed-price procurement transaction with a contractor of that entity type that is awarded by either a recipient of a DoD grant or cooperative agreement or a subrecipient that received a subaward at any tier below that grant or cooperative agreement.
(b) —(1)  Because almost all DoD grants and cooperative agreements are cost-type awards, appendix C includes wording for Section A of FMS Article III that specifies use of the applicable Governmentwide cost principles in the determination of the allowability of costs.
Award terms and conditionsGeneral.(2)  A DoD Component may reserve any paragraph of appendix C's wording for Section A of FMS Article III in its general terms and conditions if the Component is certain that no entities of the type to which the paragraph applies could be recipients of awards using those general terms and conditions or recipients of subawards or procurement transactions at any tier under those awards.


Exception.1128.315SECTION1§ 1128.315   Clarification concerning allowability of publication costs.(a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must clarify that a recipient must charge publication costs consistently as either direct or indirect costs in order for those costs to be allowable charges to DoD grants and cooperative agreements.
Requirement.(b) —(1)  To clarify the allowability of publication costs, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section B of FMS Article III.
Award terms and conditionsGeneral.(2)  A DoD Component may instead reserve Section B of FMS Article III in its general terms and conditions if the DoD Component determines that there will be no publication costs under any of the awards using those general terms and conditions.


Exception.1128.320SECTION1§ 1128.320   Period of availability of funds.(a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the period during which Federal funds are available for obligation by recipients for project or program purposes.
Requirement.(b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section C of FMS Article III to specify the period of availability of funds.


Award terms and conditions.1128.325SECTION1§ 1128.325   Fee or profit.(a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that recipients may neither receive fee or profit nor pay fee or profit to subrecipients.
Requirement.(b)  A DoD Component must use the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section D of FMS Article III to specify the limitation on payment of fee or profit.


Award terms and conditions.DSUBPARTSubpart D—Revision of Budget and Program Plans (FMS Article IV)1128.400SECTION1§ 1128.400   Purpose of FMS Article IV.FMS Article IV of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements related to changes in recipients' budget and program plans. It thereby implements OMB guidance in § 200.308 of 2 CFR part 200 and partially implements § 200.209 and Subpart E of that part.


1128.405SECTION1§ 1128.405   Content of FMS Article IV.(a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the changes in budget and program plans for which a recipient is required to request DoD Component prior approval and the procedures for submitting those requests.
Requirement.(b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include as FMS Article IV the § wording appendix D to this part provides, with any revisions to the wording that are authorized by §§ 1128.410 through 1128.430.


Award terms and conditions.1128.410SECTION1§ 1128.410   Approved budget.(a)  As described in 2 CFR 200.308(a), the approved budget for a grant or cooperative agreement may include both the Federal and non-Federal shares of funding under the award or only the Federal share.
OMB guidance.(b)  For DoD grants and cooperative agreements, the approved budget includes the Federal share and any cost sharing or matching that the recipient is required to provide under the award.
DoD implementation.(c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must include the wording appendix D to this part provides for Section A of FMS Article IV.


Award terms and conditions.1128.415SECTION1§ 1128.415   Prior approvals for non-construction activities.(a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(c) through (e) addresses prior approval requirements for revisions of a recipient's budget and program plans under a non-construction grant or cooperative agreement, which includes, for the purposes of this section, non-construction activities under an award that supports both construction and non-construction.
OMB guidance.(b)  The following paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section provide details of the DoD implementation of the guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(c) through (e) and paragraph (h) specifies the corresponding award terms and conditions. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards may require additional prior approvals for budget and program revisions ( prior approvals other than those authorized by this subpart) only in accordance with the exceptions provisions of 2 CFR 1126.3.
DoD implementation of the guidance.i.e.,(c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must require that a recipient obtain DoD Component prior approval:
Scope or objective, cost sharing or matching, and additional Federal funds.(1) For a change in scope or objective of the project or program, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(i).
(2) For any change in the cost sharing or matching included in the approved budget for which FMS Article VI requires prior approval, as described in OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(vii).
(3) If the need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project or program, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(viii).
(d)  A DoD Component must include the following prior approval requirements in general terms and conditions of research awards and may include them in general terms and conditions of other non-construction awards:
Personnel changes, disengagements, or reductions in time.(1) A change in a key person, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(ii).
(2) A principal investigator's or project director's disengagement from, or reduction in time devoted to, the project or program, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(iii).
(e)  With respect to waivers of prior approvals required by the cost principles, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(iv):
Costs requiring prior approval under the cost principles.(1) Any waiver of a cost principles requirement for prior approval by a recipient entity's cognizant agency for indirect costs is appropriately addressed in award-specific terms and conditions, rather than general terms and conditions, because the general terms and conditions must be appropriate for use in awards to multiple recipient entities.
(2) A DoD Component may waive requirements in the cost principles for recipients to request prior approval before charging certain costs as direct costs to awards. However, the DoD Component should carefully consider each prior approval requirement individually and decide:
(i) Which, if any, to waive; and
(ii) Whether to make the waiver of the prior approval requirement contingent on specified conditions ( a DoD Component might waive the prior approval required for direct charging of special purpose equipment purchases under an award but elect to waive it only up to a certain dollar value).
e.g.,(f)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards may include prior approval requirements for:
Transfers of funds and subawards.(1) Transfers of funds for participant support costs, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(v).
(2) Subawarding of work under an award, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1)(vi).
(3) Transfers of funds among direct cost categories, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(e), but the wording in the general terms and conditions must make clear that the prior approval requirement applies only to awards using those terms and conditions if the Federal share of the total value is in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold. As a matter of DoD policy, requiring prior approvals for transfers among direct cost categories generally is not appropriate for the general terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements that support research.
(g)  (1) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may authorize recipients to incur project costs up to 90 calendar days prior to the beginning date of the period of performance, at their own risk, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(1). OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(4) makes that authorization the default policy for research awards. Therefore, a DoD Component must use this policy in general terms and conditions for research awards unless exceptional circumstances provide the basis for overriding that policy.
Pre-award costs, carry forward of unobligated balances, and no-cost extensions.(2) If a DoD Component's general terms and conditions are used for awards that have multiple periods of performance, the DoD Component should authorize recipients to carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent periods of performance, as described in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(3), unless there are compelling reasons not to do so.
(3) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may authorize recipients to initiate one-time extensions in the periods of performance of their awards by up to 12 months, subject to the conditions described in 2 CFR 200.308(d)(2), but only if the DoD Component judges that authorizing no-cost extensions for awards using the general terms and conditions will not cause the DoD Component to fail to comply with DoD funding policies ( the incremental program budgeting and execution policy for research funding) contained in Volume 2A of the DoD Financial Management Regulation, DoD 7000.14-R.
e.g.,(h)  Appendix D to this part provides wording for inclusion in Section B of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions in accordance with paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section. Specifically:
Award terms and conditions.(1) In accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must include the wording that appendix D provides for paragraphs B.1.a and B.1.i of FMS Article IV and, if there will be cost sharing or matching required under any awards using the general terms and conditions, paragraph B.1.g.
(2) In accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for research awards must include the wording that appendix D provides for paragraphs B.1.b and B.1.c of FMS Article IV. A DoD Component also may include paragraphs B.1.b and B.1.c in general terms and conditions for other non-construction awards.
(3) In accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must include the wording that appendix D provides for paragraph B.1.d of FMS Article IV unless the DoD Component decides to waive any requirements in the applicable cost principles for recipients to obtain prior approval before including certain types of costs as direct charges to awards. If a DoD Component elects to waive any of those prior approval requirements, it must add wording to paragraph B.1.d to identify the specific types of costs for which recipients need not obtain DoD Component prior approval (thereby leaving in place the other prior approval requirements in the cost principles).
(4) In accordance with paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards may include the wording that appendix D provides for paragraphs B.1.e, B.1.f, and B.1.h (except as noted for research awards in paragraph (f)(3) of this section) and Section C of FMS Article IV. A DoD Component may modify the wording as specified in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section ( to limit the authorization for pre-award costs in non-construction awards other than research to a period of less than 90 calendar days prior to the beginning date of the period of performance).
e.g.,(5) If no awards using a DoD Component's general terms and conditions will support non-construction activities, the DoD Component may reserve section B.1 of the wording that appendix D provides for FMS Article IV.


1128.420SECTION1§ 1128.420   Prior approvals for construction activities.(a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(1) through (4) addresses prior approval requirements for revisions of a recipient's budget and program plans under a construction grant or cooperative agreement or construction activities under an award that supports both construction and non-construction activities.
OMB guidance.(b)  DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(1) through (4) through terms and conditions of awards for construction. A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for construction awards may require additional prior approvals for budget and program revisions ( prior approvals other than those authorized by this subpart) only in accordance with the exceptions provisions of 2 CFR 1126.3.
DoD implementation of the guidance.i.e.,(c)  In a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for construction awards or awards supporting construction activities, the DoD Component:
Award terms and conditions.(1) Must include the wording that appendix D to this part provides for paragraph B.2 of FMS Article IV.
(2) May reserve or remove the wording appendix D to this part provides for paragraph B.1 and Section C of FMS Article IV unless some awards using the general terms and conditions will also support non-construction activities (if the DoD Component elects to remove Section C, it should redesignate Section D in the article as Section C).


1128.425SECTION1§ 1128.425   Additional prior approval for awards that support both non-construction and construction activities.(a)  Guidance on an additional prior approval requirement for grants or cooperative agreements that support both construction and non-construction activities is contained in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(5).
OMB guidance.(b)  DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(5) through terms and conditions for awards that support both non-construction and construction activities.
DoD implementation of the guidance.(c)  If a DoD Component establishes general terms and conditions for awards that support both non-construction and construction activities, the DoD Component may add the prior approval requirement for funding or budget transfers between construction and non-construction activities that is described in OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(g)(5). The wording that appendix D to this part provides for Section B of FMS Article IV includes a reserved paragraph B.3 in which the DoD Component may add appropriate wording to include that prior approval requirement.


Award terms and conditions.1128.430SECTION1§ 1128.430   Procedures for prior approvals.(a)  Guidance on procedures related to recipient requests for prior approval is contained in 2 CFR 200.308(h) and (i).
OMB guidance.(b)  DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.308(h) and (i) for prior approval requests through award terms and conditions.
DoD implementation of the guidance.(c)  A DoD Component must:
Award terms and conditions.(1) Include the wording appendix D to this part provides for paragraph D.1 of FMS Article IV of its general terms and conditions.
(2) Insert appropriate wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph D.2 that appendix D to this part includes in FMS Article IV to specify:
(i) The format the recipient must use when it requests approval for budget revisions. As described in 2 CFR 200.308(h), the award term may allow the recipient to submit a letter of request or otherwise must specify that the recipient use the same format it used for budget information in its application or proposal.
(ii) Any other procedural instructions related to requests for prior approvals for budget or program revisions ( to whom requests must be submitted) that are common to the awards using the general terms and conditions. For procedural instructions that will vary from one award to another, it is appropriate to include wording that points to the award-specific terms and conditions as the source of the information.


e.g.,ESUBPARTSubpart E—Non-Federal Audits (FMS Article V)1128.500SECTION1§ 1128.500   Purpose of FMS Article V.FMS Article V of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements related to audits required under the Single Audit Act, as amended (31 U.S.C., chapter 75). The article thereby implements for grants and cooperative agreements the OMB guidance in Subpart F of 2 CFR part 200.


1128.505SECTION1§ 1128.505   Content of FMS Article V.(a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address audit requirements.
Requirement.(b) —(1)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix E to this part provides for FMS Article V.
Award terms and conditionsGeneral.(2)  A DoD Component may reserve Section B of the wording in appendix E if there will be no subawards to for-profit entities under any award using those terms and conditions.


Exception.FSUBPARTSubpart F-Cost Sharing or Matching (FMS Article VI)1128.600SECTION1§ 1128.600   Purpose of FMS Article VI.FMS Article VI sets forth requirements concerning recipients' cost sharing or matching under awards. It thereby implements OMB guidance in:
(a) 2 CFR 200.306 and 200.308(c)(1)(vii); and
(b) 2 CFR 200.434, in conjunction with FMS Article III in appendix C to this part.


1128.605SECTION1§ 1128.605   Content of FMS Article VI.(a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for awards under which there may be required cost sharing or matching must specify the criteria for determining allowability, methods for valuation, and requirements for documentation of cost sharing or matching.
Requirement.(b) —(1)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include as FMS Article VI the wording appendix F to this part provides, with any revisions to the wording that are authorized by §§ 1128.610 through 1128.635.
Award terms and conditionsGeneral.(2)  A DoD Component may reserve FMS Article VI of its general terms and conditions if it determines that there will be no cost sharing or matching required under any of the awards using those terms and conditions.


Exception.1128.610SECTION1§ 1128.610   General requirement for cost sharing or matching.(a)  (1) FMS Article VI of the general terms and conditions must tell a recipient that:
Requirement.(i) It may find the amount or percentage of cost sharing or matching required under its award in the award cover pages.
(ii) The cost sharing or matching amount or percentage identified in the award includes all required (but not voluntary uncommitted) contributions to the project or program by the recipient and its subrecipients, including any that involve third-party contributions or donations to the recipient and subrecipients.
(iii) It must obtain the DoD Component's prior approval for any change in the required amount or percentage of cost share or match.
(2) At a DoD Component's option, FMS Article VI also may require a recipient to obtain the DoD Component's prior approval if it wishes to substitute alternative cost sharing or matching contributions in lieu of specific contributions included in the approved budget ( to use a third-party in-kind contribution not included in the approved budget).
e.g.,(b)  To implement paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section A of FMS Article VI. A DoD Component may insert wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.2.b if it elects to require recipients to obtain prior approval before substituting alternative cost sharing or matching contributions, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.


Award terms and conditions.1128.615SECTION1§ 1128.615   General criteria for determining allowability as cost sharing or matching.(a)  The OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(b) lists the basic criteria for the allowability of cost sharing or matching under grants and cooperative agreements.
OMB guidance.(b) —(1)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section B of FMS Article VI to specify the allowability of cash or third-party in-kind contributions as cost sharing or matching.
Award terms and conditionsGeneral.(2)  A DoD Component may reserve paragraph B.4 of Section B of FMS Article VI in its general terms and conditions, or replace it with appropriate alternative wording, if the DoD Component has statutory authority to accept costs reimbursed by other Federal awards as cost sharing or matching under the awards using its general terms and conditions.


Exception.1128.620SECTION1§ 1128.620   Allowability of unrecovered indirect costs as cost sharing or matching.(a)  The OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(c) provides that unrecovered indirect costs may only be included as part of cost sharing and matching with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency.
OMB guidance.(b)  DoD Components must allow any recipient that either has an approved negotiated indirect cost rate or is using the de minimis rate described in 2 CFR 200.414(f) to count unrecovered indirect costs toward any required cost sharing or matching under awards. The basis for this policy is that recipients' indirect costs that are allowable and allocable to DoD projects and programs are legitimate costs of carrying out those projects and programs.
DoD implementation.(c)  To implement the policy in paragraph (b) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section C of FMS Article VI unless a statute requires otherwise.


Award terms and conditions.1128.625SECTION1§ 1128.625   Allowability of program income as cost sharing or matching.(a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.307(e)(3) specifies that, with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency, recipients may use program income to meet cost sharing or matching requirements of their awards.
OMB guidance.(b) —(1)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section D of FMS Article VI if, in FMS Article VII of those terms and conditions, the DoD Component specifies that recipients dispose of program income using either:
Award terms and conditionsGeneral.(i) The cost sharing or matching alternative described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of § 1128.720; or
(ii) A combination alternative, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of § 1128.720, that includes use of at least some program income as cost sharing or matching.
(2)  A DoD Component may reserve Section D of FMS Article VI if FMS Article VII of those terms and conditions does not provide that recipients will use any program income as cost sharing or matching.


Exception.1128.630SECTION1§ 1128.630   Valuation of services or property contributed or donated by recipients or subrecipients.(a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(d) specifies:
OMB guidance.(1) That values for recipients' and subrecipients' contributions of services or property toward cost sharing or matching must be established in accordance with the cost principles in Subpart E of 2 CFR part 200; and
(2) Types of projects or programs under which recipients' or subrecipients' donations of buildings or land are allowable as cost sharing or matching, with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency, and how the donations are to be valued in those cases.
(b)  DoD implements the guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(d) through award terms and conditions, with the following clarifications:
DoD implementation.(1)  (i) Values for recipients' and subrecipients' contributions of services or property toward cost sharing or matching must be established in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity making the contribution.
Cost principles to be used for valuation.(ii) Consistent with the cost principles, what generally should be charged to awards for real property and equipment is depreciation rather than allowing a recipient's or subrecipient's donation of the property ( counting the full value of the property toward cost sharing or matching). However, depreciation included in a recipient's or subrecipient's indirect costs is not appropriate for counting as cost sharing or matching under an individual award.
i.e.,(2)  (i) In addition to donations of buildings or land described in 2 CFR 200.306(d), recipients and subrecipients may, with the prior approval of the DoD Component, donate other capital assets described in the cost principles in 2 CFR 200.439(b)(1) through (3). The basis for clarifying that recipients may donate other capital assets to projects or programs under awards is that, with the DoD Component's approval:
Donations of property to projects or programs under awards.(A) Capital expenditures to acquire those types of capital assets are allowable as direct charges to awards; and
(B) The costs therefore satisfy the allowability criterion in 2 CFR 200.306(b)(4) and can qualify as cost sharing or matching if they meet the other criteria listed in 2 CFR 200.306(b).
(ii) However, when there are alternative ways for recipients to meet requirements for cost sharing or matching, DoD Components should not approve donations of capital assets to projects or programs under awards. Inclusion of the full value of a donated asset as project costs in the approved budget of an award is analogous to inclusion of the acquisition cost for an asset that is purchased under the award. Through the donation, the Federal Government acquires an interest in the donated asset that must be resolved at time of disposition of the asset, which is best avoided if possible.
(iii) Whenever a DoD Component permits a recipient to donate a capital asset to a project or program under an award, the DoD Component should inform the cognizant Federal agency that negotiates the indirect cost rate for that recipient. Doing so enables the cognizant agency to take the donation into account when it establishes the recipient's indirect cost rate, given that the recipient may not include depreciation for the donated asset as indirect costs that enter into the computation of that rate.
(c) —(1)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix F to this part provides as Section E of FMS Article VI.
Award terms and conditionsGeneral.(2)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may reserve paragraph E.2 of the wording appendix F to this part provides if the DoD Component does not allow recipients to donate buildings, land, or other capital assets to projects or programs under awards using those terms and conditions.


Exception.1128.635SECTION1§ 1128.635   Valuation of third-party in-kind contributions.(a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.306(e) through (j) and 2 CFR 200.434(b) through (g) specifies how to value and document various types of third-party in-kind contributions for cost sharing or matching purposes.
OMB guidance.(b) —(1)  To implement the OMB guidance described in paragraph (a) of this section as it applies to valuation and documentation of third-party in-kind contributions, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording Section VI of appendix F to this part provides as Section F of FMS Article VI.
Award terms and conditionsGeneral.(2)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may reserve any paragraph of the wording appendix F to this part provides for Section F of FMS Article VI if the DoD Component determines that there will be no possibility of third-party in-kind contributions under awards using those terms and conditions.


Exception.GSUBPARTSubpart G-Program Income (FMS Article VII)1128.700SECTION1§ 1128.700   Purpose of FMS Article VII.FMS Article VII of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements for program income that recipients earn. The article thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.80 and 200.307.


1128.705SECTION1§ 1128.705   Content of FMS Article VII.(a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address the kinds of income included as program income, the way or ways in which a recipient may use it, the duration of the recipient's accountability for it, and related matters.
Requirement.(b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include as FMS Article VII the wording appendix G to this part provides, unless, as authorized by §§ 1128.710 through 1128.725, there are revisions to the wording of Sections A and E of the article or Section D is reserved.


Award terms and conditions.1128.710SECTION1§ 1128.710   What program income includes.(a)  Under the definition of “program income” at 2 CFR 200.80 and related OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.307, an agency's regulations or terms and conditions of grants and cooperative agreements may include as program income:
OMB guidance.(1) Rebates, credits, discounts, and interest earned on any of them; and
(2) Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines and other similar revenue raised by a governmental recipient.
(b)  Unless a statute or program regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment specifies otherwise, each DoD Component must exclude the types of income listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section from program income for which recipients are accountable to the Federal Government.
DoD implementation.(c)  — (1)  Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a DoD Component must use the wording provided in appendix G to this part as Section A of FMS Article VII in its general terms and conditions. Doing so excludes the types of income listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section from program income for which recipients are accountable to the Federal Government.
Award terms and conditionsGeneral.(2)  If a DoD Component has a statutory or regulatory basis for including either or both types of income described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, it may do so by appropriately revising the wording appendix G provides for Section A of FMS Article VII. For example, to include as program income:
Exceptions.(i) Rebates, credits, discounts, and interest earned on them, a DoD Component would reserve paragraph A.3.c and insert the wording of that paragraph as a new paragraph at the end of section A.2, thereby adding them to the list of items included as program income subject to FMS Article VII.
(ii) Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines and other similar revenue raised by a governmental recipient, a DoD Component would reserve paragraph A.3.d and insert that wording as a new paragraph at the end of section A.2, thereby adding them to the list of items included as program income subject to FMS Article VII.


1128.715SECTION1§ 1128.715   Recipient obligations for license fees and royalties.(a)  Unless a statute or program regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment provides otherwise, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions may not specify that recipients have obligations to the Federal Government with respect to program income from license fees and royalties for patents or patent applications, copyrights, trademarks, or inventions produced under DoD awards.
Policy.(b) —(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must implement the policy in paragraph (a) of this section by including the wording provided in appendix G to this part as Section D of FMS Article VII.
Award terms and conditionsGeneral.(2)  If a DoD Component has a statutory or regulatory basis for establishing recipient obligations for the license fees and royalties described in paragraph (a) of this section, it may reserve Section D of FMS Article VII in its general terms and conditions.


Exception.1128.720SECTION1§ 1128.720   Program income use.(a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.307(e) identifies alternative ways that a Federal agency might specify that recipients use program income they earn.
OMB guidance.(b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify how recipients are to use program income under awards using those terms and conditions.
DoD implementation.(1) The terms and conditions may specify one of the following ways for recipients to use program income:
(i)  A recipient under this alternative adds program income to the total amount of the approved budget, which consists of the Federal share of funding and any required matching or cost sharing.
Addition.(ii)  A recipient using this alternative subtracts program income from total allowable costs to determine net allowable costs for purposes of determining the Federal share of funding and any required cost sharing or matching.
Deduction.(iii)  Under this alternative, a recipient counts program income toward its required cost sharing or matching.
Cost sharing or matching.(iv)  The fourth alternative is a combination of any of the three alternatives described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. For example, an agency might specify one alternative to be used for program income up to a dollar limit and a second alternative for any program income beyond that amount.
Combination.(2) For research awards, absent compelling reasons to do otherwise for a specific set of general terms and conditions, a DoD Component must specify the addition alternative described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
(3) For general terms and conditions of other awards, a Component may specify any of the alternatives described in paragraph (a) of this section. However, the cost sharing or matching alternative is best used as part of a combination alternative, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, unless the DoD Component knows at the time awards are made how much program income recipients will earn in relation to the amounts of their required cost sharing or matching.
(c)  (1)  In accordance with the DoD implementation in paragraph (b) of this section, a DoD Component must use the wording provided in appendix G to this part as Section E of FMS Article VII in:
Award terms and conditions.Default—addition alternative.(i) Research awards; and
(ii) Other awards for which it elects to specify the addition alternative for use of program income.
(2)  A DoD Component electing to specify the deduction alternative for use of program income must modify the wording appendix G to this part provides for Section E by:
Deduction alternative.(i) Substituting the following wording for the wording of paragraph E.1: “1. You must use any program income that you earn during the period of performance under this award as a deduction from the total approved budget of this award. The program income must be used for the purposes and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award.”
(ii) Including an additional paragraph E.4, such as the following, to inform recipients how the award will change if program income is deducted: “If you report program income on the Federal Financial Report (SF-425), we will recalculate the Federal share of the budget and the non-Federal share if there is one. We also will modify the award to reflect the recalculated share or shares and the amount of program income you must spend on the project, which is the difference between the originally approved and recalculated budget amounts.”
(3)  A DoD Component electing to specify the cost-sharing or matching alternative for use of program income must replace the wording appendix G to this part provides for Section E with the following wording: “You must use any program income that you earn during the period of performance under this award to meet any cost-sharing or matching requirement under this award. The program income must be used for the purposes and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award.”
Cost-sharing or matching alternative.(4)  A DoD Component electing to specify some combination of addition, deduction, and cost-sharing or matching alternatives must use wording in Section E of FMS Article VII that specifies requirements for each alternative in the combination that is consistent with the requirements specified for that alternative in paragraphs (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this section.


A combination of alternatives.1128.725SECTION1§ 1128.725   Program income after the period of performance.(a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.307(f) provides that an agency may specify in agency regulations, grant or cooperative agreement terms and conditions, or agreements negotiated with recipients during the closeout process that a recipient is accountable to the Federal Government for program income earned after the end of the period of performance.
OMB guidance.(b)  A DoD Component should rarely, if ever, establish a requirement for a recipient to be accountable to the Federal Government for program income earned after the end of the period of performance.
DoD implementation.(c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include as Section F of FMS Article VII the wording for that section that is provided in appendix G to this part. That wording specifies that recipients are not accountable to the Federal Government for program income earned after the end of the performance period. If an exception is warranted for an individual award, the exception is properly addressed at the time of award in the award-specific terms and conditions.

Section C. Internal controls.e.g.,FMS Article I. Financial Management System Standards. (DECEMBER 2014)
Appendix B to Part 1128APPENDIX1Appendix B to Part 1128—Terms and Conditions for FMS Article II, “Payments”
Unless a DoD Component adds, deletes, or modifies wording, as permitted by §§ 1128.210 through 1128.220, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the following wording for FMS Article II.
 If the award-specific terms and conditions of this award do not identify it as an award subject to Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205 (Department of the Treasury regulations implementing the Cash Management Improvement Act), then this award is subject to Subpart B of that part. Consistent with Subpart B of 31 CFR part 205:
Section A. Awards to States.1. 
Payment method, timing, and amounts. You must:a. Minimize the time between your receipt of a payment under this award and your disbursement of those funds for program purposes.
b. Limit the amount of each advance payment request to the minimum amount you need to meet your actual, immediate cash requirements for carrying out the program or project.
c. Submit each advance payment request approximately 10 days before you anticipate disbursing the requested amount for program purposes, so that your receipt of the funds will be as close in time as is administratively feasible to your actual cash outlay for direct project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs.
2.  Unlike awards subject to Subpart A of 31 CFR part 205, neither you nor we will incur any interest liability due to a difference in timing between your receipt of payments under this award and your disbursement of those funds for project or program purposes.
Interest.Section B. Awards to institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, local governments, and Indian tribes.1.  Unless the award-specific terms and conditions of this award provide otherwise, you are authorized to request advance payments under this award. That authorization is contingent on your continuing to maintain, or demonstrating the willingness to maintain, written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between your receipt of each payment and your disbursement of the funds for program purposes. Note that you are not required to request advance payments and may instead, at your option, request reimbursements of funds after you disburse them for project or program purposes.
Payment method.2.  You must:
Amounts requested.a. Limit the amount of any advance payment request to the minimum amount needed to meet your actual, immediate cash requirements for carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project, including direct project costs and a proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs.
b. Exclude from any payment request amounts you are withholding from payments to contractors to assure satisfactory completion of the work. You may request those amounts when you make the payments to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to ensure satisfactory completion of the work.
c. Exclude from any payment request amounts from any of the following sources that are available to you for program purposes under this award: program income, including repayments to a revolving fund; rebates; refunds; contract settlements; audit recoveries; and interest earned on any of those funds. You must disburse those funds for program purposes before requesting additional funds from us.
3.  For any advance payment you request, you should submit the request approximately 10 days before you anticipate disbursing the requested amount for project or program purposes. With time for agency processing of the request, that should result in payment as close as is administratively feasible to your actual disbursements for project or program purposes.
Timing of requests.4.  You may request payments as often as you wish unless you have been granted a waiver from requirements to receive payments by electronic funds transfer (EFT). If you have been granted a waiver from EFT requirements, the award-specific terms and conditions of this award specify the frequency with which you may submit payment requests.
Frequency of requests.5.  We will withhold payments for allowable costs under the award at any time during the period of performance only if one or more of the following applies:
Withholding of payments.a. We suspend either payments or the award, or disallow otherwise allowable costs, as a remedy under OAR Article III due to your material failure to comply with Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of this award. If we suspend payments and not the award, we will release withheld payments upon your subsequent compliance. If we suspend the award, then amounts of payments are subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms and conditions of OAR Article III.
b. You are delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A-129, “Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables,” in which case we may, after reasonable notice, inform you that we will not make any further payments for costs you incurred after a specified date until you correct the conditions or liquidate the indebtedness to the Federal Government.
c. The award-specific terms and conditions of this award include additional requirements that provide for withholding of payments based on conditions identified during our pre-award risk evaluation, in which case you should have been notified about the nature of those conditions and the actions needed to remove the additional requirements.
6. 
Depository requirements.a. There are no eligibility requirements for depositories you use for funds you receive under this award.
b. You are not required to deposit funds you receive under this award in a depository account separate from accounts in which you deposit other funds. However, FMS Article I requires that you be able to account for the receipt, obligation, and expenditure of all funds under this award.
c. You must deposit any advance payments of funds you receive under this award in insured accounts whenever possible and, unless any of the following apply, you must deposit them in interest-bearing accounts:
i. You receive a total of less than $120,000 per year under Federal grants and cooperative agreements.
ii. You would not expect the best reasonably available interest-bearing account to earn interest in excess of $500 per year on your cash balances of advance payments under Federal grants and cooperative agreements.
iii. The best reasonably available interest-bearing account would require you to maintain an average or minimum balance higher than it would be feasible for you to do within your expected Federal and non-Federal cash balances.
iv. A foreign government or banking system precludes your use of interest-bearing accounts.
d. You may retain for administrative expenses up to $500 per year of interest that you earn in the aggregate on advance payments you receive under this award and other Federal grants and cooperative agreements. You must remit annually the rest of the interest to the Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management System, using the procedures set forth in OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.305(b)(9).
Section C. Electronic funds transfer and other payment procedural instructions or information.1.  Unless the award-specific terms and conditions of this award provide otherwise, you will receive payments under this award by electronic funds transfer.
Electronic funds transfer.2. [Reserved]




FMS Article II. Payments. (DECEMBER 2014)
Appendix C to Part 1128APPENDIX1Appendix C to Part 1128—Terms and Conditions for FMS Article III, “Allowable Costs, Period of Availability of Funds, and Fee or Profit”
Unless a DoD Component reserves sections or paragraphs of this article, as permitted by §§ 1128.310 through 1128.325, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the following wording for FMS Article III.
 This section, with the clarification provided in Section B, specifies which Federal cost principles must be used in determining the allowability of costs charged to this award, a subrecipient's costs charged to any cost-type subaward that you make under this award, and a contractor's costs charged to any cost-type procurement transaction into which you enter under this award. These cost principles also govern the allowable costs that you or a subrecipient of a subaward at any tier below this award may consider when establishing the amount of any fixed-amount subaward or fixed-price procurement transaction at the next lower tier. The set of cost principles to be used in each case depends on the type of entity incurring the cost under the award, subaward, or contract.
Section A. Allowable costs.1.  If you, your subrecipient, or your contractor is:
General case.a. , the allowability of costs must be determined in accordance with provisions of Subpart E of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200 other than 2 CFR 200.400(g), supplemented by appendix III to that part.
An institution of higher educationb. , the allowability of costs must be determined in accordance with provisions of appendix IX to 2 CFR part 200, which currently specifies the cost principles in appendix IX to 45 CFR part 75 as the applicable cost principles.
A hospitalc. , the allowability of costs must be determined in accordance with provisions of Subpart E of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200 other than 2 CFR 200.400(g), supplemented by appendices IV and VIII to that part. In accordance with guidance in 2 CFR 200.401(c), a nonprofit organization listed in appendix VIII to 2 CFR part 200 is subject to the cost principles for for-profit entities specified in paragraph 1.e of this section.
A nonprofit organization other than a hospital or institution of higher educationd. , the allowability of costs must be determined in accordance with applicable provisions of Subpart E of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200 other than 2 CFR 200.400(g), supplemented by appendices V through VII to that part.
A State, local government, or Indian tribee. 
A for-profit entity (other than a hospital) or a nonprofit organization listed in appendix VIII to 2 CFR part 200:i. The allowability of costs must be determined in accordance with:
(A) The cost principles for commercial organizations in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at Subpart 31.2 of 48 CFR part 31, as supplemented by provisions of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) at Subpart 231.2 of 48 CFR part 231; and
(B) For a for-profit entity, the additional provisions on allowability of audit costs, in 32 CFR 34.16(f).
ii. The indirect cost rate to use in that determination is:
(A) The for-profit entity's federally negotiated indirect cost rate if it has one.
(B) Subject to negotiation between you and the for-profit entity if it does not have a federally negotiated indirect cost rate. The rate that you negotiate may provide for reimbursement only of costs that are allowable in accordance with the cost principles specified in paragraph A.1.e.i of this article.
2.  You may use your own cost principles in determining the allowability of a contractor's costs charged to a cost-type procurement transaction under this award—or in pricing for a fixed-price contract based on estimated costs—as long as your cost principles comply with the Federal cost principles that paragraph A.1 of this section identifies as applicable to the contractor.
Exception. For an entity that Section A of this article makes subject to the cost principles in Subpart E of 2 CFR part 200:
Section B. Clarifications concerning charges for professional journal publications.1. Costs of publishing in professional journals are allowable under 2 CFR 200.461(b) only if they are consistently applied across the organization.

2. “Costs of publication or sharing of research results” in 2 CFR 200.461(b)(3) are the “charges for professional journal publications” described in 2 CFR 200.461(b) and subject to the conditions of 2 CFR 200.461(b)(1) and (2).
 You may charge to this award only:
Section C. Period of availability of funds.1. Allowable costs incurred during the period of performance specified in this award, including any subsequent amendments to it;
2. Any pre-award costs that you are authorized (by either the terms and conditions of FMS Article IV or the DoD awarding official) to incur prior to the start of the period of performance, at your own risk, for purposes of the project or program under this award; and
3. Costs of publishing in professional journals incurred after the period of performance, as permitted under 2 CFR 200.461(b)(3), if:
a. We receive the request for payment for such costs no later than the date on which REP Article II requires you to submit the final financial report to us (or, if we grant your request for an extension of the due date, that later date on which the report is due); and
b. Your reported expenditures on the final financial report include the amount you disbursed for those costs.
Section D. Fee or profit.1. You may not receive any fee or profit under this award.
2. You may not use funds available to you under this award to pay fee or profit to an entity of any type to which you make a subaward.
3. You may pay fee or profit to an entity with which you enter into a procurement transaction to purchase goods or general support services for your use in carrying out the project or program under the award.

Appendix E to Part 1128APPENDIX1Appendix E to Part 1128—Terms and Conditions for FMS Article V, “Non-Federal Audits”
Unless a DoD Component reserves Section B, as permitted by § 1128.605, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for FMS Article V.
 You and each subrecipient under this award that is an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, State, local government, or Indian tribe must comply with the audit requirements specified in Subpart F of 2 CFR part 200, which is the OMB implementation of the Single Audit Act, as amended (31 U.S.C. chapter 75).
Section A. Requirements for entities subject to the Single Audit Act. Any for-profit entity that receives a subaward from you under this award is subject to the audit requirements specified in 32 CFR 34.16. Your subaward terms and conditions will require the subrecipient to provide the reports to you if it is willing to do so, so that you can resolve audit findings that pertain specifically to your subaward ( disallowance of costs). If the for-profit entity is unwilling to agree to provide the auditor's report to you, contact the grants officer for this award to discuss an alternative approach for carrying out audit oversight of the subaward. If the grants officer does not provide an alternative approach within 30 days of receiving your request, you may determine an approach to ensure the for-profit subrecipient's compliance with the subaward terms and conditions, as described in OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.501(h).


Section B. Requirements for for-profit entities.e.g.,FMS Article V. Non-Federal Audits (DECEMBER 2014)
Appendix F to Part 1128APPENDIX1Appendix F to Part 1128—Terms and Conditions for FMS Article VI, “Cost Sharing or Matching”
Unless a DoD Component reserves FMS Article VI in its entirety, reserves one or more paragraphs within sections of the article, or includes added or alternate wording, as permitted by §§ 1128.610 through 1128.635, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for FMS Article VI.
.
Section A. Required cost sharing or matching1. If any cost sharing or matching is required under this award, the total amount or percentage required is shown in the award cover pages and included in the approved budget. That cost sharing or matching includes all:
a. Cash contributions to the project or program either made by or through (if made by a third party) you and any subrecipients.
b. Third-party in-kind contributions to the project or program.
2. You must obtain our prior approval if you wish to:
a. Change the amount or percentage of cost sharing or matching required under this award.
b. [Reserved]
 Each cash or third party in-kind contribution toward any cost sharing or matching required under this award, whether put forward by you or a subrecipient under a subaward that you make, is allowable as cost sharing or matching if:
Section B. Allowability as cost sharing or matching.1. You (or the subrecipient, if it is a subrecipient contribution) maintain records from which one may verify that the contribution was made to the project or program and, if it is a third-party in-kind contribution, its value.
2. The contribution is not counted as cost sharing or matching for any other Federal award.
3. The contribution is:
a. Allowable under the cost principles applicable to you (or the subrecipient, if it is a subrecipient contribution) under FMS Article III of these terms and conditions; and
b. Allocable to the project or program and reasonable.
4. The Government does not pay for the contribution through another Federal award, unless that award is under a program that has a Federal statute authorizing application of that program's Federal funds to other Federal programs' cost sharing or matching requirements.
5. The value of the contribution is not reimbursed by the Federal share of this award as either a direct or indirect cost.
6. The contribution conforms to the other terms and conditions of this award, including the award-specific terms and conditions.
 You may use your own or a subrecipient's unrecovered indirect costs as cost sharing or matching under this award. Unrecovered indirect costs means the difference between the amount of indirect costs charged to the award and the amount that you and any subrecipients could have charged in accordance with your respective approved indirect cost rates, whether those rates are negotiated or de minimis (as described in 2 CFR 200.414(f)).
Section C. Allowability of unrecovered indirect costs as cost sharing or matching. If FMS Article VII of these general terms and conditions or the award-specific terms and conditions of this award specify that you are to use some or all of the program income you earn to meet cost-sharing or matching requirements under the award, then program income is allowable as cost sharing or matching to the extent specified in those award terms and conditions.
Section D. Allowability of program income as cost sharing or matching. You must establish values for services or property contributed or donated toward cost sharing or matching by you or subrecipients in accordance with the provisions of this section. These contributions or donations are distinct from third-party in-kind contributions to you or subrecipients, which are addressed in Section F of this article.
Section E. Valuation of services or property that you or subrecipients contribute or donate.1.  Values established for contributions of services or property by you or a subrecipient must be the amounts allowable in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity making the contribution ( you or the subrecipient), as identified in FMS Article III. For property, that generally is depreciation.
Usual valuation of services or property that you or subrecipients contribute or donate.i.e.,2. 
Needed approvals for, and valuation of, property that you or subrecipients donate.a. 
Types of property that may be donated.i.  If the purposes of this award include construction, facilities acquisition, or long-term use of real property, you may donate buildings or land to the project if you obtain our prior approval. Donation of property to the project, as described in PROP Article I, means counting the value of the property toward cost sharing or matching, rather than charging depreciation.
Buildings or land.ii.  If you obtain our prior approval, you may donate to the project other capital assets identified in 2 CFR 200.439(b)(1) through (3).
Other capital assets.b.  Unless you obtain our approval as described in paragraph E.2.c of this article, the value for the donated property must be the lesser of:
Usual valuation of donated property.i. The value of the remaining life of the property recorded in your accounting records at the time of donation, or
ii. The current fair market value.
c.  If you obtained our approval in the approved budget, you may count as cost sharing or matching the current fair market value of the donated property even if it exceeds the value of the remaining life of the property recorded in your accounting records at the time of donation.
Approval needed for alternative valuation of property.d.  Donating buildings, land, or other property to the project, rather than charging depreciation, results in a Federal interest in the property in accordance with PROP Article I of these terms and conditions.
Federal interest in donated property.Section F. Valuation of third-party in-kind contributions.1.  If a third party furnishes goods or services to you or subrecipients that are to be counted toward cost sharing or matching under this award, the entity to which the third party furnishes the goods or services ( you or a subrecipient) must document the fair market value of those in-kind contributions and, to the extent feasible, support those values using the same methods the entity uses internally.
General.i.e.,2.  You must establish values for third-party volunteer services and services of third parties' employees furnished to you or subrecipients as follows:
Valuation of third-party services.a.  Volunteer services furnished by third-party professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor must be valued in accordance with 2 CFR 200.306(e).
Volunteer services.b.  When a third-party organization furnishes the services of its employees to you or a subrecipient, values for the contributions must be established in accordance with 2 CFR 200.306(f).
Services of third parties' employees.c.  For volunteer services or services of third parties' employees furnished to a nonprofit organization:
Additional requirement for donations to nonprofit organizations.i. OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.434(e) also applies and may require the nonprofit organization to allocate a proportionate share of its applicable indirect costs to the donated services.
ii. The indirect costs that the nonprofit organization allocates to the donated services in that case must be considered project costs and may be either reimbursed under the award or counted toward required cost sharing or matching, but not both.
3.  You must establish values for third-party property furnished to you or subrecipients as follows:
Valuation of third-party property.a.  When a third-party organization donates supplies ( office, laboratory, workshop, or classroom supplies), the value that may be counted toward cost sharing or matching may not exceed the fair market value of the supplies at the time of donation.
Supplies donated by third parties.e.g.,b. 
Equipment, buildings, or land donated by third parties.i. The value of third-party donations of equipment, buildings, or land that may be counted toward cost sharing or matching when the third party transferred title to you or a subrecipient depends on the purpose of the award in accordance with the following:
(A) If one of the purposes of the award is to assist you or the subrecipient in the acquisition of equipment, buildings, or land, you may count the aggregate fair market value of the donated property toward cost sharing or matching.
(B) If the award's purposes instead include only the support of activities that require the use of equipment, buildings, or land, you may only charge depreciation unless you obtain our prior approval to count as cost sharing or matching the fair market value of equipment or other capital assets and fair rental charges for land.
ii. The values of the donated property must be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the entity to which the third party transferred title to the property, with the qualifications specified in 2 CFR 200.306(i)(1) and (2) for donated land and buildings and donated equipment, respectively.
c.  If a third party makes space available for use by you or a subrecipient, the value that you may count toward cost sharing or matching may not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal, as described in 2 CFR 200.306(i)(3).
Use of space donated by third parties.d.  If a third party loans equipment for use by you or a subrecipient, the value that you may count toward cost sharing or matching may not exceed its fair rental value.

It thereby implements OMB guidance for grants and cooperative agreements:
(a) Pertaining to vesting of title to property, in 2 CFR 200.311(a), 200.312(a), 200.313(a), 200.314(a), and 200.315(a).
(b) Pertaining to the property trust relationship in 2 CFR 200.316.


1130.105SECTION1§ 1130.105   Title to property acquired under awards.(a)  Title to tangible property that a recipient acquires under an award (whether by purchase, construction or fabrication, development, or otherwise), and title to intangible property that a recipient acquires other than by developing or producing it under an award, generally vests in the recipient subject to the conditions in PROP Articles II-IV and Section D of PROP Article VI, which protect the Federal interest in the property.
General policy.(b) —(1)  If a DoD Component has statutory authority to do so, it may vest title in recipients to property acquired under awards either unconditionally or subject to fewer conditions than those in PROP Articles II-IV and VI. This subpart refers to acquired property for which a DoD Component has such statutory authority—and elects to use it—as “exempt property.”
Exceptions to the general policy when there is statutory authorityExempt property in general.(2)  (i) Under 31 U.S.C. 6306, a DoD Component may vest title to tangible personal property ( equipment and supplies) in a nonprofit institution of higher education or nonprofit organization whose primary purpose is conducting scientific research—without further obligation to the Federal Government or subject to conditions the DoD Component deems appropriate—if the property is bought with amounts provided under a grant or cooperative agreement for basic or applied research.
Research awards.i.e.,(ii) As a matter of policy, to enhance the university infrastructure for future performance of defense research and research-related education and training, DoD Components must make maximum use of the authority of 31 U.S.C. 6306 to vest title to equipment in nonprofit institutions of higher education subject to only the following three conditions:
(A) The recipient uses the equipment for the authorized purposes of the project or program until the property is no longer needed for those purposes.
(B) The recipient manages the equipment as provided in PROP Article II of the general terms and conditions (see Subpart B of this part). This includes maintaining property records that include the percentage of Federal participation in the costs of the project or program under which the recipient acquired the exempt property, so that the recipient may deduct the Federal share if it wishes to use the property in future contributions for cost sharing or matching purposes on Federal awards.
(C) The DoD Component reserves the right to transfer title to the equipment to another recipient entity if the Principal Investigator relocates his or her research program to that entity.
(c) —(1)  Unless a DoD Component has a statute authorizing it to identify acquired property as exempt property, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, it must use the wording appendix A to this part provides for Section A of PROP Article I.
Award terms and conditionsGeneral.(2)  (i) If a DoD Component has statutory authority such as described in paragraph (b) of this section, and elects to use that authority for awards subject to its general terms and conditions, it must insert wording in paragraph A.2 of PROP Article I to:
Exceptions.(A) Identify the type or types of property it is exempting from the standard requirements for title vesting, use, and disposition contained in PROP Articles II through IV and VI and reporting requirements contained in REP Article III of the general terms and conditions.
(B) If it is exempting the property from some, but not all, of the standard requirements, identify the requirements to which the exempt property will be subject.
(ii) Paragraph A.2 of PROP Article I in general terms and conditions used for research awards to institutions of higher education and nonprofit organizations whose primary purpose is conducting scientific research generally should provide for vesting of title to acquired equipment and supplies in those types of entities when they are conducting basic or applied research subject only to the three conditions described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.


1130.110SECTION1§ 1130.110   Property trust relationship.(a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.316 describes the property trust relationship. It states that:
OMB guidance.(1) Recipients must hold real property, equipment, and intangible property acquired or improved under grants or cooperative agreements in trust for the beneficiaries of the projects or programs under which the property was acquired or improved; and
(2) A Federal agency may require a recipient to record liens or other appropriate notices of record to indicate that personal or real property was acquired or improved under a grant or cooperative agreement, making the property's use and disposition subject to the award terms and conditions.
(b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that recipients hold title to real property, equipment, and intangible property acquired or improved under DoD grants and cooperative agreements in trust for the beneficiaries of the projects or programs carried out under those awards.
DoD implementation.(c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions:
Award terms and conditions.(1) Must include the wording appendix A to this part provides for paragraph B.1 of PROP Article I, except that a DoD Component may instead reserve Section B if there will be no acquisition or improvement of real property, equipment, or intangible property under awards using those general terms and conditions or subawards under those awards.
(2) May add wording to the reserved paragraph B.2 of the wording of Section B of PROP Article I to require recipients to record liens or other notices of record, as described in paragraph (a) of this section.


1130.115SECTION1§ 1130.115   Title to federally owned property.(a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must inform recipients that title to federally owned property remains with the Federal Government and include the wording appendix A to this part provides for Section C of PROP Article I.
Requirement.(b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must either:
Award terms and conditions.(1) Include the wording appendix A to this part provides for Section C of PROP Article I to indicate that title to federally owned property remains with the Federal Government; or
(2) Reserve Section C if it provides no federally owned property under its awards.


1130.120SECTION1§ 1130.120   Federal interest in donated property.(a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must inform recipients that the Federal Government acquires an interest in any real property or equipment for which the value of the remaining life of the property in the recipient's accounting records or the fair market value of the property is counted toward required cost sharing or matching, rather than charging depreciation.
Requirement.(b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must either:
Award terms and conditions.(1) Include the wording appendix A to this part provides for Section D of PROP Article I to specify the Federal interest in donated real property or equipment; or
(2) Reserve Section D of PROP Article I if the DoD Component does not permit recipients to count the fair market value of real property or equipment toward cost sharing or matching.


1130.125SECTION1§ 1130.125   Federal interest in property improved under awards.(a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address the Federal interest in improvements to real property or equipment that results if a recipient directly charges the costs of the improvements to an award.
Requirement.(b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must either:
Award terms and conditions.(1) Include the wording appendix A to this part provides for Section E of PROP Article I to specify the Federal interest in improved real property or equipment; or
(2) Reserve Section E of PROP Article I if there will be no improvements to real property or equipment under awards using those general terms and conditions or subawards under those awards.


BSUBPARTSubpart B—Property Management System (PROP Article II)1130.200SECTION1§ 1130.200   Purpose of PROP Article II.(a) PROP Article II prescribes standards for:
(1) Insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired or improved under awards;
(2) The system that a recipient uses to manage both equipment that is acquired or improved in whole or in part under awards and federally owned property.
(b) It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.310 and 200.313(d)(1) through (4), and partially implements 2 CFR 200.313(b).


1130.205SECTION1§ 1130.205   Insurance coverage for real property and equipment.(a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.310 includes a requirement for recipients' insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired or improved under grants and cooperative agreements and states that federally owned property need not be insured unless required by Federal award terms and conditions.
OMB guidance.(b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must require recipients to provide insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired or improved under awards. However, unless a statute or program regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment specifies otherwise, DoD awards will not require recipients to insure federally owned property.
DoD implementation.(c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions therefore must either:
Award terms and conditions.(1) Include the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section A of PROP Article II; or

The types of non-exempt property to which this article applies are:
Section A. Property subject to this article.1. Supplies that you acquire either by purchase or by donation as cost sharing or matching under this award; and
2. Equipment for which title is vested conditionally in you. That includes equipment with a conditional title resulting from your having, either under this award or under a previous award from which you transferred accountability for the equipment to this award:
a. Directly charged as project costs, in whole or in part, the acquisition (by purchase, construction or fabrication, or development) of equipment;

4. When the equipment is no longer needed for the project or program under this award, you may defer final disposition of the equipment and continue to use it on other federally sponsored projects or programs. You must give first priority to other projects or programs supported by DoD Components.
5. Notwithstanding the encouragement in FMS Article VII to earn program income, you may not use equipment in which there currently is a Federal interest—whether you acquired it under this award or are otherwise accountable for it under this award—to provide services for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services.
 You must request disposition instructions from the award administration office when either original or replacement equipment acquired under this award with a current fair market value that exceeds $5,000 is no longer needed for the original project or program or for other federally sponsored activities as described in paragraph C.4 of this article. For each item of equipment with a current fair market value of $5,000 or less, you may retain, sell, or otherwise dispose of the item with no further obligation to the Federal Government.
Section D. Disposition of equipment by an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, local government, or Indian tribe.1. We may issue disposition instructions that:
a. Allow you to retain or sell any item of equipment after compensating us for the Federal interest in the property, which is to be computed as specified in the definition of “Federal interest;” or
b. Require you to transfer title to the equipment to a Federal agency or a third party, in which case you are entitled to compensation from us for the non-Federal interest in the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred.
2. If we fail to provide disposition instructions for any item of equipment within 120 calendar days of receiving your request, you may retain or sell the equipment, but you must compensate us for the amount of the Federal interest in the equipment.
3. If you sell the equipment:
a. You must use sales procedures designed to ensure the highest possible return; and
b. You may deduct and retain for selling and handling expenses either $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less.
Section E. Use and disposition of supplies acquired under this award.1.  As long as we retain a Federal interest in supplies acquired under this award either by purchase or by donation as cost sharing or matching, you may not use the supplies to provide services to other organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, notwithstanding the encouragement in FMS Article VII to earn program income.
Use.2.  If you have a residual inventory of unused supplies with aggregate value exceeding $5,000 at the end of the period of performance under this award, and the supplies are not needed for any other Federal award, you must retain the supplies or sell them but must in either case compensate us for the amount of the Federal interest in the supplies. You may deduct and retain for selling and handling expenses either $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less.

ii. Insert the terms “award” and “subaward (or contract under either the award or a subaward)” to replace the terms “contract” and “subcontract,” respectively.
b.  Add a new subparagraph (f)(5) to read, “The recipient must submit a final report listing all subject inventions made under the award or stating that there were none. The final report is due 90 calendar days after the end date of the period of performance unless you request, and we grant, an extension of the due date.”
Final report.c.  Delete paragraphs (g)(2) and (3) of the Governmentwide clause, redesignate paragraph (g)(1) as paragraph (g) and delete the phrase “to be performed by a small business firm or domestic nonprofit organization” from paragraph (g) as redesignated.
Broadening applicability to all entities.Section C. Data produced under the award.1.  The Federal Government has the right to:
Data in general.a. Obtain, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the data produced under this award; and
b. Authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the data produced under this award for Federal Government purposes.
2. 
Research data requested under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).a. If we receive a request under the FOIA for “research data” that are related to “published research findings” produced under this award and that were “used by the Federal Government in developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law,” you must provide the data to us within a reasonable time after we request it from you, so that the data can be made available to the public through procedures established under the FOIA.
b. For purposes of the requirement in paragraph C.2.a of this section, 2 CFR 200.315(e) provides definitions of the phrases “published research findings,” “used by the Federal Government in developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law,” and “research data.”

1134.2SECTION1§ 1134.2   Applicability of this part.The types of awards and entities to which this part and other parts in this subchapter apply are described in the subchapter overview at 2 CFR 1126.2.


1134.3SECTION1§ 1134.3   Exceptions from requirements of this part.Exceptions are permitted from the administrative requirements in this part only as described at 2 CFR 1126.3.


1134.4SECTION1§ 1134.4   Organization of this part.(a) The content of this part is organized into subparts and associated appendices.
(1) Each subpart provides direction to DoD Components on how to construct one article of general terms and conditions for grants and cooperative agreements.
(2) For each subpart, there is a corresponding appendix with standard wording for terms and conditions of the article addressed by the subpart. Terms and conditions address rights and responsibilities of the Federal Government and recipients.
(b) A DoD Component must use the wording provided in each appendix in accordance with the direction in the corresponding subpart. That direction may permit DoD Components to vary from the standard wording in some situations.
(c) Table 1 shows which article of general terms and conditions may be found in each of appendices A through D to this part (with the associated direction to DoD Components in Subparts A through D, respectively):

It thereby implements OMB guidance for grants and cooperative agreements in:
(a) 2 CFR 200.328; and
(b) Portions of 2 CFR 200.301 and 200.343(a) that relate to performance reporting.


1134.105SECTION1§ 1134.105   Performance reporting for construction awards.(a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(c) notes that agencies rely heavily on onsite technical inspections and certified percentage of completion data to monitor progress under construction grants and cooperative agreements and states that agencies may require additional performance reports only when considered necessary.
OMB guidance.(b)  DoD Components may require performance reports under construction awards only when necessary and, to reduce recipient burdens, should coordinate the performance reporting with financial reporting to the maximum extent practicable.
DoD implementation.(c)  (1) If a DoD Component has general terms and conditions specifically for construction awards and does not need performance reports for those awards, it:
Award terms and conditions.(i) Should reserve Sections A through D of REP Article I in those terms and conditions;
(ii) Must follow the specifications in §§ 1134.135 and 1134.145 to include the wording appendix A to this part provides for Sections E and G of REP Article I in those terms and conditions, in order to require recipients to promptly report significant developments and reserve the DoD Component's right to make site visits.
(iii) Must follow the specifications in § 1134.140 to insert wording in Section F of REP Article I in those terms and conditions, to tell recipients where and how to submit any reports of significant developments.
(2) If a DoD Component has general terms and conditions specifically for construction awards and determines that it needs performance reports for those awards:
(i) It may tailor the template and content that appendix A to this part provides for Sections A through D of REP Article I in those terms and conditions, as needed to specify the reporting requirements or, as appropriate, instead integrate those requirements into REP Article II on financial reporting. The form, format, or data elements that the DoD Component specifies for any of those performance reports must comply with requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, as implemented by OMB at 5 CFR part 1320, to use OMB-approved information collections if more than 9 recipients will be subject to the reporting requirement.
(ii) It must follow the specifications in §§ 1134.135 through 1134.145 concerning Sections E through G of REP Article I in those terms and conditions, as described in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section.


1134.110SECTION1§ 1134.110   Performance reporting for non-construction awards.(a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(f) states that an agency may waive any performance report that it does not need.
OMB guidance.(b) —(1)  DoD Components should waive requirements for interim performance reports under non-construction awards, including research awards, only when program managers have an alternative source for the information that the reports provide in support of the need for technical program oversight during the period of performance.
DoD implementationInterim reports.(2) —(i)  DoD Components may not waive requirements for final performance reports under research awards, even when program managers have other sources of the information they contain. A primary purpose of a final report under a research award is to document the overall project or program well enough to serve as a long-term reference from which others may understand the purpose, scope, approach, results or outcomes, and conclusions or recommendations of the research.
Final reportsResearch.(ii)  DoD Components should consider the long-term value of final performance reports for documenting program outcomes, as well as any near-term value, before waiving requirements for final reports under other non-construction awards.
Non-construction awards other than research.(c)  Appendix A to this part provides a template for REP Article I of the general terms and conditions of research awards or other non-construction awards under which performance reports are required. A DoD Component must either use the wording that appendix A provides or insert wording into the template, in accordance with §§ 1134.115 through 1134.145, to:
Award terms and conditions.(1) Specify the content and form, format, or data elements recipients must use for interim and final performance reporting (see § 1134.115);
(2) Specify the reporting frequency, reporting periods, and due dates for interim performance reports (see § 1134.120);
(3) Specify the due dates and reporting periods for final performance reports (see § 1134.125);
(4) Specify that recipients may request extensions of due dates for performance reports (see § 1134.130);
(5) Require recipients to report significant developments (see § 1134.135);
(6) Specify reporting procedures (see § 1134.140); and
(7) Reserve the DoD Component's right to make site visits (see § 1134.145).


1134.115SECTION1§ 1134.115   Content and forms, formats, or data elements for interim and final performance reporting under non-construction awards.(a)  OMB guidance in:
OMB guidance.(1) 2 CFR 200.301 and 200.328(b)(2) state that Federal awarding agencies must require recipients to use standard OMB-approved information collections for reporting performance information.
(2) 2 CFR 200.328(b)(2)(i) through (iii) list types of information that performance reports under non-construction grants and cooperative agreements will contain, as appropriate, unless other collections are approved by OMB.
(b)  (1) The content of the information collections that a DoD Component's general terms and conditions specify for non-construction awards must include the elements listed in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(2)(i) through (iii) that are appropriate to the projects or programs subject to those general terms and conditions.
DoD implementation.(2) Forms, formats, and data elements that a DoD Component's general terms and conditions specify for performance reporting under non-construction awards must comply with requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 to use OMB-approved information collections, as implemented by OMB at 5 CFR part 1320.
(3) To the maximum extent practicable, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must specify that recipients use Governmentwide standard forms, formats, and data elements that also are used by other Federal agencies for similar programs, recipients, and types of awards ( the Research Performance Progress Report format or any successor to it that OMB clears for interim performance progress reports under research awards to institutions of higher education and nonprofit organizations).
e.g.,(c)  To implement the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a DoD Component must insert wording in lieu of the reserved Section A of REP Article I of its general terms and conditions for non-construction awards to specify the form, format, or data elements that recipients must use for interim and final performance reports. Section A of REP Article I may specify a different requirement for final performance reports than interim reports.


Award terms and conditions.1134.120SECTION1§ 1134.120   Frequency, reporting periods, and due dates for interim performance reporting under non-construction awards.(a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1) addresses performance reporting frequency under grants and cooperative agreements and due dates.
OMB guidance.(1)  The OMB guidance states that interim performance reports should be no less frequent than annually, nor more frequent than quarterly except in unusual circumstances ( when more frequent reporting is necessary for effective program monitoring).
Reporting frequency.e.g.,(2)  The OMB guidance states that due dates for interim performance reports must be:
Due dates.(i) 30 calendar days after the end of the reporting period if interim reports are required quarterly or semiannually; and
(ii) 90 calendar days after the end of the reporting period if interim reports are required annually, unless the agency elects to require the annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiyear awards.
(b)  DoD implements the OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1) concerning frequency and due dates of interim performance reports through award terms and conditions, with the following clarifications and added specifications concerning reporting periods:
DoD implementation.(1)  DoD Components rarely, if ever, should require recipients to submit interim performance reports more often than annually for basic research awards. Before requiring interim performance reports more frequently than annually for other research awards, DoD Components should carefully consider whether the benefits of more frequent reporting are sufficient to offset the potential for slowing the rate of research progress, due to diversion of researchers' time from research performance to report preparation.
Reporting frequency.(2)  For research awards, a DoD Component should not require any recipient to submit interim performance reports on a cumulative basis— the second and any subsequent performance report should address only the most recent reporting period and not also address previous reporting periods covered by earlier interim performance reports.
Reporting periods.i.e.,(3)  If a DoD Component requires an interim report more frequently than quarterly due to unusual circumstances, as described in 2 CFR 200.328(a)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the DoD Component must specify that the due date for the report is 30 days after the end of the reporting period. For all other interim reports, DoD Components must specify due dates in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
Due dates.(c)  A DoD Component must insert wording in lieu of the reserved Section B of REP Article I of its general terms and conditions for non-construction awards to specify:
Award terms and conditions.(1) The frequency with which recipients must submit interim performance reports;
(2) The reporting period each interim performance report must cover; and
(3) The due date for each interim performance report, stated as the number of calendar days after the end of the reporting period.


1134.125SECTION1§ 1134.125   Due dates and reporting periods for final performance reports under non-construction awards.(a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1) states that each final performance report will be due 90 calendar days after the end date of the period of performance. It also states that an agency may extend the due date if a recipient submits a justified request.
OMB guidance.(b) —(1)  Consistent with 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1):
DoD implementationDue dates.(i)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify that the due date for each recipient's submission of its final performance report is:
General.(A) 90 calendar days after the end of the period of performance for non-construction awards other than research.
(B) 120 calendar days after the end of the period of performance for research awards.
(ii)  A DoD Component may pre-approve a 30-day extension to the due date in its general terms and conditions for non-construction awards other than research by specifying that each recipient's final performance report is due 120 calendar days after the end of the period of performance. Doing so would be especially helpful to recipients that have subawards and need time to assimilate subrecipient inputs into the final report for the project or program as a whole.
Exception.(2) —(i)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards other than research may require each recipient to submit a final report that is cumulative and covers the entire period of performance, as that may more effectively document the project or program for future reference.
Reporting periodsNon-construction awards other than research.(ii)  Final reports for research awards must be cumulative ( each final report must cover the entire period of performance under the award and not just the period since the previous interim performance report) because a primary purpose of a final report for a research award is to document the overall project or program, as described in § 1134.110(b)(2).
Research.i.e.,(c)  To implement the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a DoD Component in its general terms and conditions for non-construction awards:
Award terms and conditions.(1) Must either:
(i) Specify that the due date for final performance reports is either 90 or 120 calendar days after the end of the period of performance, as indicated in paragraph (b)(1)(i), by including the wording that appendix A to this part provides for paragraph C.1 of REP Article I and modifying the bracketed language in that wording by removing the brackets and showing only the number of days ( 90 or 120 calendar days) appropriate for the type of awards; or
i.e.,(ii) Pre-approve a 30-day extension to the 90 calendar day due date, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section for non-construction awards other than research, by including the wording that appendix A to this part provides for paragraph C.1 of REP Article I and modifying the bracketed language in that wording by removing the brackets and showing only “120 calendar days” in lieu of “90 calendar days.”
(2) Must insert wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph C.2 of REP Article I, to specify the reporting period for final reports ( that research awards require cumulative final reports).


e.g.,1134.130SECTION1§ 1134.130   Requesting extensions of due dates for performance reports.(a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(b)(1) states that, if a recipient submits a justified request for an extension in the due date for any interim or final performance report under a grant or cooperative agreement, an agency may extend the due date.
OMB guidance.(b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must specify that a recipient may request an extension of the due date for interim or final performance reports. DoD Components should grant requests that provide adequate justification. For a DoD Component that pre-approves a 30-day extension of due dates for final performance reports in its general terms and conditions, as described in § 1134.125(b)(1)(ii) and (c)(1)(ii), any award-specific extensions would be beyond the pre-approved 30-day extension.
DoD implementation.(c)  To implement the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions for non-construction awards must include the wording that appendix A to this part provides for Section D of REP Article I on extensions of performance reporting due dates.


Award terms and conditions.1134.135SECTION1§ 1134.135   Reporting significant developments.(a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(d) states that a recipient must promptly notify the awarding agency about significant developments under grants and cooperative agreements.
OMB guidance.(b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must require recipients to report significant developments, as described in 2 CFR 200.328(d).
DoD implementation.(c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording that appendix A to this part provides for Section E of REP Article I on reporting of significant developments.


Award terms and conditions.1134.140SECTION1§ 1134.140   Performance reporting procedures.(a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must inform recipients about performance reporting procedures.
Requirement.(b)  To implement the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component in its general terms and conditions must insert wording in Section F of REP Article I (which is reserved in the template for REP Article I that appendix A to this part provides), to specify:
Award terms and conditions.(1) The office or offices to which a recipient must submit its interim and final performance reports, any requests in due dates for those reports, and any reports of significant developments; and
(2) How the recipient is to submit those reports and requests ( email or other electronic submission method).
e.g.,(3) For research awards, component must assure that the recipient final report complies with the distribution and marking requirements of DoD Manual 3200.14, Volume 1. This includes the requirement that all significant scientific or technological findings, recommendations, and results derived from DoD endeavors—which shall include the final performance report at a minimum—are recorded and provided to Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC). Follow guidance in (b)(1) to inform recipients as the submission and distribution requirements ( Component may choose to receive the report and submit to DTIC themselves or provide instructions to recipient on submission to DTIC).
i.e.(4) Access to Research Results
(i) For purposes of this term and condition, the following definition applies:
 The final version of a peer-reviewed article for a professional journal publication disclosing the results of scientific research which is authored or co-authored by the recipient or funded, in whole or in part, with funds from a DoD award, that includes all modifications from the publishing peer review process, and all graphics and supplemental material associated with the article.
Final Peer-Reviewed Manuscript:(ii) The recipient shall ensure that any Final Peer-Reviewed Manuscript is submitted to the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) repository, currently at  Ensure that the Final Peer-Reviewed Manuscript is submitted when it is accepted for publication, and when the final title and date of publication are known.


www.dtic.mil.1134.145SECTION1§ 1134.145   Site visits.(a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.328(e) states that a Federal awarding agency may make site visits as warranted by program needs.
OMB guidance.(b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must state that the Federal Government reserves the right to make site visits as warranted.
DoD implementation.(c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording that appendix A to this part provides for Section G of REP Article I concerning site visits.


Award terms and conditions.BSUBPARTSubpart B—Financial Reporting (REP Article II)1134.200SECTION1§ 1134.200   Purpose of REP Article II.REP Article II of the general terms and conditions specifies requirements related to financial reporting. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.327 and the portions of 2 CFR 200.301 and 200.343(a) that are specific to financial reporting under grants and cooperative agreements.


1134.205SECTION1§ 1134.205   Reporting forms, formats, or data elements.(a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.327 states that Federal awarding agencies may require recipients to use only the standard OMB-approved Governmentwide data elements for collection of financial information, unless OMB approves other forms, formats, or data elements for financial information collection.
OMB guidance.(b)  DoD Components must collect financial information from recipients using OMB-approved forms, formats, or data elements.
DoD implementation.(1) Unless current approvals expire, approved financial information collections include the Federal Financial Report (SF-425) and Request for Advance or Reimbursement (SF-270). In the future, they would include any additional information collections that OMB approves.
(2) For all but the recipient's final financial report, a DoD Component may rely on financial information the recipient provides on the SF-270 or other OMB-approved payment request form, format, or data elements if that financial information is sufficient to meet the DoD Component's needs. For the final report, the DoD Component must require the recipient to use the SF-425 or other OMB-approved financial information collection.
(3) A DoD Component must obtain approval for any variations from OMB-approved forms or formats, including use of additional or substitute data elements or modification of the associated instructions for recipient entities submitting the information.


1134.210SECTION1§ 1134.210   Content of REP Article II.(a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify what financial information recipients are required to report and how often, when, where, and how they must report.
Requirement.(b) —(1)  Appendix B to this part provides a template into which a DoD Component must insert wording to specify the form, format, or data elements recipients must use for financial reporting; the frequency, reporting periods, and due dates for their financial reports (stated as the number of days after the end of the reporting period); and where and how they must submit the information.
Award terms and conditionsGeneral.(2)  In Section A of REP Article II, which is reserved in appendix B to this part, a DoD Component must insert wording to specify the OMB-approved form, format, or data elements that recipients must use for financial reporting and the website where they can be found. The section may provide a different requirement for final financial reports than interim reports during the period of performance if the DoD Component needs less information on interim reports than is needed on the final report.
Required reporting form, format, or data elements for interim and final financial reports.(3)  In Section B of REP Article II, which is reserved in appendix B to this part, a DoD Component must insert wording to specify the frequency with which recipients must submit interim financial reports, as well as the reporting period each report must cover and when it is due. However, this section of the article may waive interim reporting requirements if the DoD Component relies on information already provided with payment requests ( on the SF-270).
Interim financial reports: Frequency, reporting periods, and due dates.e.g.,(i) Consistent with OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.327, the reporting frequency may be no less often than annually and no more frequently than quarterly except in unusual circumstances ( a need for more frequent reporting for monitoring program performance, in which case financial reporting should be coordinated with performance reporting).
e.g.,(ii) The reporting frequency, reporting periods, and due dates must conform with any guidance on those aspects of financial reporting in the OMB-approved instructions accompanying the form, format, or data elements used.
(iii) When a DoD Component's general terms and conditions provide for advance payments based on predetermined schedules—which is very rarely if ever appropriate for research awards—the terms and conditions must provide for quarterly reporting. This will enable post-award administrators to closely monitor recipients' balances of cash on hand for compliance with Governmentwide cash management standards.
(4)  Appendix B to this part provides wording for Section C of REP Article II to implement OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.343(a) as it applies to final financial reports. Given that 2 CFR part 200 provides 90 days for subrecipients to liquidate subaward obligations and submit their final financial reports to recipients, the wording in appendix B gives recipients 120 days to submit final financial reports to DoD post-award administration offices. That provides a reasonable amount of time for recipients to incorporate any information they need from final subaward reports. A DoD Component may alter the wording or supplement it if the DoD Component has a basis to do so in a statute or a regulation published in the Code of Federal Regulations.
Final financial report.(5)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include the wording for Section D of REP Article II that appendix B to this part provides to authorize recipients to request extensions of due dates for interim or final financial reports.
Extensions of due dates.(6)  In Section E of REP Article II, which is reserved in appendix B to this part, a DoD Component must insert wording to specify the DoD official or office to whom a recipient must submit its interim and final financial reports and the method it must use to do so ( email or other electronic submission method).


Where and how to submit financial reports.e.g.,CSUBPARTSubpart C—Reporting on Property (REP Article III)1134.300SECTION1§ 1134.300   Purposes of REP Article III.REP Article III of the general terms and conditions provides a consolidated source that sets out required reports, notifications, requests, and accountings related to federally owned property and property that is acquired or improved under awards. The article is:
(a) The original source of requirements for recipients to:
(1) Submit periodic status reports and notifications of critical changes for real property (in paragraphs A.1 and A.2 of the article), which thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.329;
(2) Submit an annual inventory of federally owned property (in paragraph C.1 of the article), which thereby partially implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.312(a);
(3) Provide information on request about copyrighted works and data produced under awards (in paragraph D.2 of the article).
(b) A secondary source provided for the convenience of recipients and DoD post-award administrators that lists and refers to the original sources of requirements for recipients to:
(1) Request disposition instructions and account at closeout for real property (in paragraphs A.3 and A.4 of the article), the original sources of which are in PROP Article III and OAR Article VI;
(2) Provide notifications of loss, damage, or theft and requests for disposition instructions for equipment (in paragraphs B.2 and B.3 of the article), the original sources of which are in PROP Articles II and IV, respectively;
(3) Account at closeout for equipment and supplies (in paragraph B.4 of the article), the original sources of which are in OAR Article VI and PROP Article IV;
(4) Provide notifications of loss, damage, or theft and requests for disposition instructions for federally owned property (in paragraphs C.2 and C.3 of the article), the original sources of which are in PROP Articles II and V, respectively;
(5) Disclose and report on inventions developed under awards (in paragraph D.1), the original source of which is in PROP Article VI; and
(6) Request disposition instructions for intangible property acquired, but not developed or produced, under awards (in paragraph D.3 of the article), the original source of which is in PROP Article VI.


1134.305SECTION1§ 1134.305   Real property: reports, notifications, requests, and accounting.(a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the real property reporting requirements described in § 1134.300(a)(1) and provide references to the related requirements described in § 1134.300(b)(1).
Requirement.(b)  To implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, the wording of Section A of REP Article III of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must comply with either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.
Award terms and conditions.(1)  Unless a DoD Component determines that there will be no acquisition or improvement of real property under awards using its general terms and conditions, those general terms and conditions must include the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section A of REP Article III, to which the DoD Component:
General.(i) Must add wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.1.a to specify how often a recipient must submit periodic status reports and how long it is required to do so (which should be the duration of the Federal interest in the real property). The wording of paragraph A.1.a must be consistent with OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.329, which provides different options for reporting frequency depending on the duration of the Federal interest in the real property.
(ii) Must add wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.1.b to specify the due date for each periodic status report in terms of the number of calendar days after the end of the period covered by the report ( a report on the status of the property as of September 30 might be due 30 calendar days after that date).
e.g.,(iii) May provide wording in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.1.c if there are other instructions— a form, format, or information elements that a recipient must use (which must be cleared by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, as implemented by OMB at 5 CFR part 1320) or a particular office to which reports must be submitted, especially if reporting will continue beyond closeout of the award under which the real property was acquired or improved.
e.g.,(2)  A DoD Component may reserve Section A of REP Article III if it determines that there will be no acquisition or improvement of real property under awards using its general terms and conditions.


Exception.1134.310SECTION1§ 1134.310   Equipment and supplies: reports, notifications, requests, and accounting.(a)  REP Article III of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must clarify that there is no requirement for routine periodic reporting about equipment acquired under an award and provide the references described in § 1134.300(b)(2) and (3) to requirements in other articles for notifications, requests, and accounting related to equipment and supplies.
Requirement.(b)  To implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section B of REP Article III.


Award terms and conditions.1134.315SECTION1§ 1134.315   Federally owned property: inventory, notifications, and requests.(a)  REP Article III of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the reporting requirement described in § 1134.300(a)(2) and provide the references described in § 1134.300(b)(4) to requirements in other articles for notifications and requests related to federally owned property.
Requirement.(b)  (1) Except as provided by statute or in regulations adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment, a DoD Component may not specify:
Policy.(i) Due dates for the annual inventories of federally owned property; or
(ii) Forms, formats, or specific data elements for the inventories, notifications, or requests for disposition instructions. Any form, format, or data elements that a DoD Component specifies must be cleared by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, as implemented by OMB at 5 CFR part 1320.
(2) Not specifying due dates, forms, formats, or data elements provides flexibility for recipients and DoD post-award administrators to handle these requirements in ways that reduce burdens and costs. For example, a recipient may arrange with a post-award administration office to submit one consolidated inventory annually for federally owned property under all of the awards it receives that are administered by that office, using a format its property management system already generates.
(c) —(1)  To implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section C of REP Article III. The DoD Component may add wording on due dates or on forms, formats, or data elements only as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
Award terms and conditionsGeneral.(2)  A DoD Component may reserve Section C of REP Article III if it determines that no recipients of awards using its general terms and conditions, or subrecipients of subawards under those awards, will be accountable for federally owned property under those awards or subawards.


Exception.1134.320SECTION1§ 1134.320   Intangible property: disclosures, reports, and requests.(a)  REP Article III of a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the requirement described in § 1134.300(a)(3) and provide the references described in § 1134.300(b)(5) and (6) to requirements in other articles for disclosures, reports, and requests related to intangible property.
Requirement.(b) —(1)  To implement the requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix C to this part provides for Section D of REP Article III.

(2) 2 CFR 200.300(b) as it refers to requirements in 2 CFR part 25; and
(3) 2 CFR 200.333 through 200.345.


1136.2SECTION1§ 1136.2   Applicability of this part.The types of awards and entities to which this part and other parts in this subchapter apply are described in the subchapter overview at 2 CFR 1126.2.


1136.3SECTION1§ 1136.3   Exceptions from requirements of this part.Exceptions are permitted from the administrative requirements in this part only as described at 2 CFR 1126.3.


1136.4SECTION1§ 1136.4   Organization of this part.(a) The content of this part is organized into subparts and associated appendices.
(1) Each subpart provides direction to DoD Components on how to construct one article of general terms and conditions for grants and cooperative agreements.
(2) For each subpart, there is a corresponding appendix with standard wording for terms and conditions of the article addressed by the subpart. Terms and conditions address rights and responsibilities of the Federal Government and recipients.
(b) A DoD Component must use the wording provided in each appendix in accordance with the direction in the corresponding subpart. That direction may permit DoD Components to vary from the standard wording in some situations.
(c) Table 1 shows which article of general terms and conditions may be found in each of appendices A through G to this part (with the associated direction to DoD Components in Subparts A through G, respectively):

The article thereby implements OMB guidance in:
(a) 2 CFR 200.113 and 200.210(b)(1)(iii);
(b) 2 CFR part 25; and
(c) The portion of 2 CFR 200.300(b) that cites 2 CFR part 25 and the System for Award Management).


1136.105SECTION1§ 1136.105   Content of OAR Article I.To implement the requirement described in § 1136.100, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the standard wording appendix A to this part provides as OAR Article I. A DoD Component may reserve Section B of the article in its general terms and conditions if it is certain that there will be no award using those general terms and conditions for which the Federal share of the award's total value will exceed $500,000.


BSUBPARTSubpart B—Records Retention and Access (OAR Article II)1136.200SECTION1§ 1136.200   Purpose of OAR Article II.OAR Article II addresses rights and responsibilities concerning retention of records related to awards; access to recipients' records; and collection, transmission, and storage of information. The article thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.333 through 200.337.


1136.205SECTION1§ 1136.205   Records retention period.(a)  OMB guidance in:
OMB guidance.(1) The lead-in paragraph of 2 CFR 200.333 sets a standard retention period that is generally applicable to recipient records pertinent to grants and cooperative agreements.
(2) 2 CFR 200.333(c) and (f) provide different standard retention periods specifically for records that are related either to real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds or indirect cost rate proposals and cost allocation plans.
(b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify the standard retention periods described in paragraph (a) of this section.
DoD implementation.(c) —(1)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section A of OAR Article II.
Award terms and conditionsGeneral.(2)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions may substitute alternative wording for paragraph A.3 of OAR Article II if the awards using those terms and conditions will be renewed quarterly or annually. The alternative wording for awards that will be renewed quarterly or annually would replace the words “final financial report” in paragraph A.3 with “quarterly financial report” or “annual financial report,” respectively.


Exception.1136.210SECTION1§ 1136.210   Extensions of retention period due to litigation, claim, or audit.(a)  OMB guidance in:
OMB guidance.(1) 2 CFR 200.333(a) provides for an extended retention period for records involved in a litigation, claim, or audit that begins before the end of the standard 3-year retention period.
(2) 2 CFR 200.333(b) provides that a recipient also is required to extend the retention period when a Federal awarding, cognizant, or oversight agency notifies it in writing to do so.
(b)  (1) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must provide for extended retention periods for records involved in a litigation, claim, or audit that begins before the end of the standard 3-year retention period, as described in 2 CFR 200.333(a).
DoD implementation.(2)(i) Other than the exception described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, DoD Components may not require recipients to extend the records retention period as described in 2 CFR 200.333(b).
(ii) A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must extend the “retention period,” as that term is used in 2 CFR 200.344(a), to include the entire period during which recipients retain their records, even if that period extends beyond the standard 3-year retention period described in § 1136.205. That extension will enable disallowance of costs and recovery of funds based on an audit or other review of records a recipient elected to retain beyond the standard retention period, even if the audit or review began after the end of that retention period. Without that extension, the ability to disallow costs and recover funds would be limited by 2 CFR 200.344(a), which states that an agency must make any disallowance determination about a recipient's costs and notify the recipient within the record retention period.
(c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section B of OAR Article II.


Award terms and conditions.1136.215SECTION1§ 1136.215   Records for program income earned after the end of the performance period.(a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.333(e) provides the retention period for records related to program income earned under a grant or cooperative agreement after the end of the period of performance, if an agency establishes requirements governing the disposition of program income earned after that time.
OMB guidance.(b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions should not establish retention requirements for records related to program income earned after the end of the period of performance. Retention requirements for those records in general terms and conditions would be inconsistent with the statement in 2 CFR 1128.725 that a DoD Component should rarely, if ever, establish a requirement for a recipient to be accountable for program income earned after the end of the period of performance. Section 1128.725 provides for use of general terms and conditions wording in FMS Article VII that establishes no such requirement. Section 1128.725 further states that exceptions for individual awards are properly addressed at the time of award in the award-specific terms and conditions.
DoD implementation.(c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section C of OAR Article II. If a DoD Component includes a requirement in the award-specific terms and conditions for the recipient to be accountable for program income earned after the end of the period of performance, it also may include a requirement in the award-specific terms and conditions for the recipient's retention of the associated records.


Award terms and conditions.1136.220SECTION1§ 1136.220   Records for joint or long-term use.(a)  OMB guidance in:
OMB guidance.(1) 2 CFR 200.334 states that a Federal awarding agency must request that a recipient transfer records to its custody if the agency determines that the records have value that warrants long-term retention. It also provides that the agency may instead arrange for the recipient to retain records that are continuously needed for joint use.
(2) 2 CFR 200.333(d) exempts records transferred to a Federal agency from the standard records retention requirement.
(b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must inform recipients that they may be asked to transfer records, maintain them for joint use, or retain them for a longer period.
DoD implementation.(c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section D of OAR Article II.


Award terms and conditions.1136.225SECTION1§ 1136.225   Methods for collecting, transmitting, and storing information.(a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.335 addresses the use of electronic and paper formats in the collection, transmission, and storage of information related to awards.
OMB guidance.(b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must include provisions consistent with the guidance in 2 CFR 200.335 for recipients' use of electronic and paper formats to collect, transmit, and store information.
DoD implementation.(c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section E of OAR Article II.


Award terms and conditions.1136.230SECTION1§ 1136.230   Access to records.(a)  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.336 and 200.337 addresses Federal Government and public access to recipient records related to grants and cooperative agreements.
OMB guidance.(b)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must provide for Federal Government access to records consistent with 2 CFR 200.336 and address public access to records to implement the guidance in 2 CFR 200.337.
DoD implementation.(c)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix B to this part provides for Section F of OAR Article II.


Award terms and conditions.CSUBPARTSubpart C—Remedies and Termination (OAR Article III)1136.300SECTION1§ 1136.300   Purpose of OAR Article III.OAR Article III addresses remedies for noncompliance, including suspension and termination of awards. It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.338 through 200.340 and 200.342.


1136.305SECTION1§ 1136.305   Content of OAR Article III.(a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify remedies available for addressing noncompliance with award terms and conditions, policies and procedures related to termination of awards, and effects of suspension and termination on allowability of costs.
Requirement.(b)  To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix C to this part provides for OAR Article III.


Award terms and conditions.DSUBPARTSubpart D—Claims, Disputes, and Appeals (OAR Article IV)1136.400SECTION1§ 1136.400   Purpose of OAR Article IV.OAR Article IV addresses claims, disputes, and appeals under awards. It thereby provides the award terms and conditions required by the DoDGARs at 32 CFR 22.815 and also implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.341.


1136.405SECTION1§ 1136.405   Content of OAR Article IV.(a)  The DoDGARs at 32 CFR 22.815 require DoD Components' general terms and conditions to incorporate the procedures set forth in that section for processing claims and disputes and deciding appeals of grants officer's decisions.
Requirement.(b) —(1)  To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix D to this part provides for OAR Article IV, with wording inserted in lieu of the reserved paragraph A.2 to identify the Component's cognizant Grant Appeal Authority and provide his or her mailing or email address.
Award terms and conditionsGeneral.(2)  A DoD Component may add one or more sections to the wording appendix D to this part provides for OAR Article IV to state a requirement that recipients must provide opportunities to subrecipients for hearings, appeals, or other administrative proceedings with respect to claims, disputes, remedies for noncompliance, or other matters if:
Exception.(i) That requirement is in a statute or regulation adopted in the Code of Federal Regulations after opportunity for public comment; and
(ii) The statutory or regulatory requirement applies to awards using the DoD Component's general terms and conditions.


ESUBPARTSubpart E—Collection of Amounts Due (OAR Article V)1136.500SECTION1§ 1136.500   Purpose of OAR Article V.OAR Article V addresses procedures for establishing, appealing, and collecting debts under DoD awards. It thereby:
(a) Provides requirements for recipients paralleling those for DoD Components in the DoDGARs at 32 CFR 22.820;
(b) Augments requirements of OAR Article IV in any case in which a claim leads to a determination that a recipient owes an amount to DoD; and
(c) Implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.345.


1136.505SECTION1§ 1136.505   Content of OAR Article V.(a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify how grants officers' decisions establish debts under awards, when debts become delinquent, how and when recipients may appeal, and how debts not paid in a timely manner are referred for debt collection.
Requirement.(b)  To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix E to this part provides for OAR Article V.


Award terms and conditions.FSUBPARTSubpart F—Closeout (OAR Article VI)1136.600SECTION1§ 1136.600   Purpose of OAR Article VI.OAR Article VI addresses recipients' responsibilities for closeout of awards and subawards under them. The article thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.343.


1136.605SECTION1§ 1136.605   Content of OAR Article VI.(a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must specify requirements related to closeout of awards and subawards, including recipients' liquidations of obligations, refunds of unobligated balances, and submission of final reports.
Requirement.(b) —(1)  To implement the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the wording appendix F to this part provides for OAR Article VI.
Award terms and conditionsGeneral.(2)  Consistent with OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.343(a), a DoD Component may grant extensions to due dates for final reports.
Exception related to due dates for final reports other than performance, financial, and invention reports.(i) To pre-approve a 30-day extension for final reports other than performance, financial, and invention reports, a DoD Component may substitute “120 calendar days” for “90 calendar days” in the wording appendix F to this part provides for paragraph C.4 of OAR Article VI. These pre-approved 30-day extensions in the general terms and conditions are for all awards using those terms and conditions; they therefore are separate and distinct from any additional extensions a recipient may later request for an individual award.
(ii) The parallel authorities for pre-approved extensions of due dates for final performance and invention reports are elsewhere. DoDGARs provisions in:
(A) 2 CFR 1134.125 authorize a DoD Component to pre-approve a 30-day extension for due dates of performance reports by an appropriate substitution of wording in REP Article I of the general terms and conditions.
(B) 2 CFR 1130.610 authorize a DoD Component to pre-approve a 30-day extension for due dates of final reports listing subject inventions under awards by an appropriate substitution of wording in PROP Article VI of the general terms and conditions.

OAR Article I. Submitting and Maintaining Recipient Information. (DECEMBER 2014)
Appendix B to Part 1136APPENDIX1Appendix B to Part 1136—Terms and Conditions for OAR Article II, “Records Retention and Access”
Unless a DoD Component substitutes alternate wording in paragraph A.3, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for OAR Article II, as specified in §§ 1136.205 through 1136.230.
 Except as provided in Sections B through D of this article:
Section A. Records retention period.1. You must keep records related to any real property and equipment acquired, in whole or in part, using Federal funds under the award for 3 years after final disposition of the property. For any item of exempt property with a current fair market value greater than $5,000, and for which final disposition was not a condition of the title vesting, you must keep whatever records you need for as long as necessary to ensure that you can deduct the Federal share if you later use the property in contributions for cost sharing or matching purposes under any Federal award.
2. You must keep records related to rate proposals for indirect or facilities and administrative costs, cost allocation plans, and supporting records such as indirect cost rate computations and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback or composite fringe benefit rates) as follows:
a. If you are required to submit a proposal, plan, or other computations to your Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs, as the basis for negotiation of a rate, you must keep the submissions and all supporting records for 3 years from the date on which you were required to make the submissions.
b. If you are not required to submit a proposal, plan, or other computation as the basis for negotiation, you must keep the proposal, plan, other computation, and supporting records for 3 years from the end of the fiscal year or other accounting period covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.
3. You must keep other financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and other records pertinent to this award for a period of 3 years from the date you submit your final financial report under the award.
Section B. Extensions of retention period due to litigation, claim, or audit.1. If any litigation, claim, or audit begins before the end of the 3-year retention period specified in Section A of this article and the final action related to the litigation, claim, or audit is not taken before the end of that 3-year period, you must retain all records related to this award that may be involved in the litigation, claim, or audit until all findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken.
2. We may disallow costs and recover funds under this award based on an audit or other review of records you elected to retain beyond the retention period required by this article, even if the audit or review begins after the end of the 3-year retention period specified in Section A of this article. Thus, the “retention period,” as that term is used in OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.344(a)(1), is extended, as described in 2 CFR 200.333(b), to include the entire period during which we and our authorized representatives continue to have access to those records under paragraph F.2 of this article.
 In accordance with Section F of FMS Article VII, there are no requirements under this award applicable to program income you earn after the end of the period of performance and therefore no associated records retention requirements.
Section C. Records for program income earned after the end of the performance period.Section D. Records for joint or long-term use.1.  To avoid duplicate recordkeeping for records that you and we both need to use on a continuous basis, we may ask you to make special arrangements with us, by mutual agreement, to make records available for joint and continuous use.
Joint use.2.  If we determine that some records will be needed longer than the 3-year period specified in Section A of this article, we may request that you either:
Long-term use.a. Retain the records for a longer period of time; or
b. Transfer the records to our custody for long-term retention.
3.  For any records transferred to our custody, you are not subject to the records retention requirements in Section A of this article.
Retention requirements for transferred records..
Section E. Methods for collecting, transmitting, and storing information1. You should, whenever practicable, collect, transmit, and store information related to this award in open and machine-readable formats rather than in closed formats or on paper. However, if you request it, we will:
a. Provide award related-information to you on paper; and
b. Accept award related-information from you on paper. In that case, we will not require more than an original and two copies.
2. When your original records are in an electronic form that cannot be altered, you do not need to create and retain paper copies of those records.
3. When your original records are on paper, you may substitute electronic versions produced through duplication or using other forms of electronic media, provided that:
a. You conduct periodic quality control reviews of the records;
b. You provide reasonable safeguards against alteration of the records; and
c. The records remain readable.
Section F. Access to records.1. 
Scope of Federal Government access rights.a. We as the awarding agency, the Federal Government Inspectors General, the Comptroller General of the United States, and any of our authorized representatives have the right of access to any documents, papers, or other records you have that are pertinent to this award, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, and transcripts.
b. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to your personnel for the purposes of interview and discussion related to the records.
c. As described in OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.336(b), the access to records described in this section will include access to the true name of a victim of a crime only under extraordinary and rare circumstances.
i. You are required to provide that access only in response to a court order or subpoena pursuant to a bona fide confidential investigation, or in response to a request duly authorized by the head of the DoD Component or his or her designee; and
ii. You must take appropriate steps to protect this sensitive information.
2.  We have the access rights described in paragraph F.1 of this section as long as you retain the records.
Duration of Federal Government access rights.3. 
Public access.a. You must comply with requirements to protect information that Federal statute, Executive order, or regulation requires to be protected ( personally identifiable or export controlled information), to include both information generated under this award and information provided to you and identified as being subject to protection. Other than those limitations on dissemination of information, we place no restrictions on you that limit public access to your records pertinent to this award.
e.g.,b. We do not place any requirements on you to permit public access to your records separate from any Federal, State, local, or tribal statute that may require you to do so.
c. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552) does not apply to records in your possession but records you provide to us generally will be subject to FOIA, with the applicable exemptions.


OAR Article II. Records Retention and Access. (DECEMBER 2014)
Appendix C to Part 1136APPENDIX1Appendix C to Part 1136—Terms and Conditions for OAR Article III, “Remedies and Termination”
As required by § 1136.305, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for OAR Article III.
. If you fail to comply with a term or condition of this award or an applicable Federal statute or regulation, we may amend this award to impose award-specific conditions, as described in OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.207. If imposing award-specific conditions, we will notify you before modifying the award and, once you have corrected the non-compliance, promptly remove the award-specific conditions. If we determine that the imposition of award-specific conditions is insufficient to correct the non-compliance or the non-compliance remains uncorrected despite the use of award-specific conditions, we may consider taking one or more of the remedies specified in Section B of this article.
Section A. Non-compliance with award terms and conditionsSection B. Remedies for noncompliance.1. If you fail to comply with a term or condition of this award or an applicable Federal statute or regulation, we may take one or more of the following actions that we deem appropriate to the circumstances:
a. Temporarily withhold cash payments pending:
i. Your correction of the deficiency; or
ii. Our taking more severe enforcement action.
b. Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable cost-sharing or matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance;
c. Suspend or, in accordance with paragraph C.1.a.i of this article, terminate this award, in whole or in part (suspension of an award is a separate and distinct action from suspension of a person under 2 CFR parts 180 and 1125, as noted in paragraph B.3 of this article);
d. Withhold further awards to you for the project or program that is not in compliance;
e. Take any other action legally available to us under the circumstances.
2. You may raise an objection to our taking any remedy we take under paragraph B.1 of this section and will be given an opportunity to provide information and documentation challenging the action. The procedures are those specified in OAR Article IV for claims and disputes.
3. Our use of any remedy under paragraph B.1 of this section, including suspension or termination of the award, does not preclude our referring the noncompliance to a suspension and debarment official and asking that official to consider initiating a suspension or debarment action under 2 CFR part 1125, the DoD implementation of OMB guidance at 2 CFR part 180.
Section C. Termination.1. This award may be terminated in whole or in part as follows:
a.  We will provide a notice of termination if we unilaterally terminate this award in whole or in part, which we may do for either of the following reasons:
Unilaterally by the Federal Government.i. Your material failure to comply with the award terms and conditions. If we terminate the award for that reason, we will report the termination to the OMB-designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS). In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 2313, each Federal awarding official must review and consider the information in the OMB-designated integrity and performance system with regard to any proposal or offer before awarding a grant or contract.
ii. The program office does not have funding for an upcoming increment if this award is incrementally funded. In that case, the Federal Government's financial obligation does not exceed the amount currently obligated under the award.
b.  With your consent, we may terminate this award, in whole or in part, for any reason. In that case, you and we must agree to:
By mutual agreement.i. The termination conditions, including the effective date; and
ii. In the case of a partial termination, the portion to be terminated.
c.  You may unilaterally terminate this award, in whole or in part, by sending us written notification that states:
Unilaterally by the recipient.i. The reasons for the termination;
ii. The effective date; and
iii. In the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. In that case, however, we may terminate the award in its entirety if we determine that the remaining portion of the award will not accomplish the purposes for which we made the award.
2. If this award is terminated in its entirety before the end of the performance period, you must complete the closeout actions for which you are responsible under OAR Article VI. The due date for each action is to be measured relative to the date of termination.
3. If this award is only partially terminated before the end of the performance period, with a reduced or modified portion of the award continuing through the end of the performance period, then closeout actions will occur at the end of the performance period as specified in OAR Article VI.
4. You will continue to have all of the post-closeout responsibilities that OAR Article VII specifies for you if this award is wholly or partially terminated before the end of the performance period.
 If we suspend or terminate this award prior to the end of the period of performance, costs resulting from obligations that you incurred:
Section D. Effects of suspension or termination of the award on allowability of costs.1. Before the effective date of the suspension or termination are allowable if:
a. You properly incurred those obligations;
b. You did not incur the obligations in anticipation of the suspension or termination;
c. In the case of termination, the costs resulted from obligations that were noncancellable after the termination; and
d. The costs would have been allowable if we had not suspended or terminated the award and it had expired normally at the end of the period of performance.
2. During the suspension or after the termination are not allowable unless we expressly authorize them, either in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently.

(a) Omit SUB Articles II through XII that are the subject of this part if the DoD Component does not allow recipients to make subawards under awards using those terms and conditions. The DoD Component also may amend SUB Article I in that case, to state the prohibition on making subawards and limit the recipient's responsibility to ensuring that any transaction it awards at the next tier is a procurement transaction.
(b) Reserve portions of SUB Articles I through XII that do not apply to the DoD Component's awards using those terms and conditions. For example, the DoD Component may reserve paragraphs in SUB Articles IV through IX specifying administrative requirements that flow down solely to subawards to States if it determines that there is no possibility of a subaward to a State under any of the awards using its general terms and conditions. Similarly, it may reserve SUB Article XII if it does not permit any fixed-amount subawards under its awards.

It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.331(a) through (c) and other portions of 2 CFR part 200 as they apply to lower-tier subawards.


1138.1105SECTION1§ 1138.1105   Content of SUB Article XI.(a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address requirements that recipients must include in subawards to entities that may make lower-tier subawards.

It thereby implements OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.201(b) and 200.332 and other portions of 2 CFR part 200 as they apply to fixed-amount subawards.


1138.1205SECTION1§ 1138.1205   Content of SUB Article XII.(a)  A DoD Component's general terms and conditions must address how a recipient may use a fixed-amount type of subaward, when it requires the Component's prior approval to do so, and what requirements the recipient must include in those subawards.

Award terms and conditionsGeneral.(2) 
Exceptions.(i) In addition to the authorities provided in § 1138.5 to omit or reserve all or portions of the wording appendix L to this part provides for SUB Article XII, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions may add wording to Section B of the article to authorize recipients to use fixed-amount subawards without obtaining the Component's prior approval in other situations for which it would be appropriate to do so, given the nature of the program or programs that use its general terms and conditions.
(ii) However, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions should never authorize recipients' use of fixed-amount subawards for basic or applied research, for the reason given in paragraph B.2.a.ii of the wording appendix L provides for SUB Article XII. It is unrealistic to have a subrecipient commit in advance to accomplishing specific, well-defined, and observable research outcomes. Doing so subjects the subrecipient to undue risk of not being reimbursed for research costs it incurred if it fails to fully accomplish the outcomes.


Appendix A to Part 1138APPENDIX1Appendix A to Part 1138—Terms and Conditions for SUB Article I, “Distinguishing Subawards and Procurements”
Unless modified as provided in § 1138.5, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for SUB Article I.
 For each transaction into which you enter with another entity at the next tier below this award, you must determine whether the transaction is a subaward or a procurement.
Section A. Required recipient determination.Section B. Considerations in making the determination.1. The primary purpose of the transaction between you and the other entity is the key factor you must use to determine whether the transaction is a subaward or a procurement.
a. The transaction is a subaward and the other entity therefore a subrecipient if the transaction's primary purpose is for you to transfer—for performance by the other entity—a portion of the substantive program for which we are providing financial assistance to you through this award. You will continue to be accountable to us for performance of the project or program under the award, including portions performed by any subrecipients.
b. The transaction is a procurement and the other entity therefore your contractor if the transaction's primary purpose is for you to purchase goods or services that you need to perform the substantive program supported by this award. The distinction from a subaward is the contractor is not performing a portion of the substantive program as a result of the transaction.
2. What you call the transaction is not a factor in distinguishing a subaward from a procurement. If the transaction meets the criterion in paragraph B.1.a of this article, it is a subaward for purposes of the requirements of this award even if you call and consider the transaction a “contract.”
Section C. Effect of the determination on the next-tier transaction.1.  One important consequence of your determining whether a next-tier transaction is a subaward or a procurement is that there are different requirements governing the pre-award and time of award processes that you use to award the transaction.
Process for awarding the transaction.a. SUB Article II of this award specifies pre-award and time of award responsibilities for subawards.
b. PROC Articles I and II of this award govern pre-award and time of award processes for awarding procurement transactions.
2.  A second important consequence of your determining whether a next-tier transaction is a subaward or a procurement is that the terms and conditions you include in a subaward differ from those you include in a procurement transaction.
Transaction terms and conditions.a. Section C of SUB Article II of this award addresses requirements you must include in subaward terms and conditions. Those requirements generally are either identical or directly related to requirements in the general terms and conditions of this award. They include national policy requirements as well as administrative requirements in areas such as financial and programmatic management, property administration, procurement, and reporting.
b. PROC Article III of this award lists requirements you must include in a procurement transaction when applicable to the procurement.


SUB Article I. Distinguishing Subawards and Procurements. (DECEMBER 2014)
Appendix B to Part 1138APPENDIX1Appendix B to Part 1138—Terms and Conditions for SUB Article II, “Pre-Award and Time of Award Responsibilities”
Unless modified as provided in § 1138.5, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for SUB Article II.
Section A. Requirements for unique entity identifiers.1.  For purposes of the unique entity identifier requirements in paragraphs A.2 and 3 of this section, “entity” has the meaning given in paragraph C.3 of appendix A to OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 25.
Definition of “entity.”2.  You must notify potential subrecipients that no entity may receive a subaward from you under this award unless it has provided its unique entity identifier to you.
Pre-notification of potential subrecipients.3. 
Restriction on making subawards.a.  You may not make a subaward to an entity unless the entity has provided its unique entity identifier to you.
General.b.  You may make a subaward to an entity that has not provided its unique entity identifier to you in rare cases in which you requested, and we approved, an exemption from the requirement for the entity to provide a unique entity identifier, based on the criteria in OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 25.110(d).
Exception.Section B. Pre-award risk assessment.1. Before making a subaward to an entity, you must perform a risk assessment of the prospective subrecipient, as described in 2 CFR 200.331(b). OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.205(c) provides examples of factors you may consider in evaluating risk.
2. As part of the risk assessment under paragraph B.1 of this article, you must:
a. Verify that neither the prospective subrecipient nor its principals under the subaward are excluded or disqualified from participating in the transaction, in accordance with requirements in Subpart C of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 180, as implemented by DoD at 2 CFR part 1125; and
b. If warranted by risks you identify, determine whether to impose award-specific terms and conditions in the subaward to mitigate the risks.
i. These award-specific terms and conditions may be in addition to, or differ from, the terms and conditions that SUB Articles IV through IX of this award require you to include in subawards.
ii. They may include items such as those listed in OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.207(b)(1) through (6).
iii. Your procedures for imposing and removing the additional or different requirements must comply with the procedural guidance in 2 CFR 200.207(c) and (d).
Section C. Subaward content.1. 
Cost-type subawards.a. SUB Article III of this award specifies informational content that you must include in each cost-type subaward.
b. SUB Articles IV through VIII specify administrative requirements that you must include:
i. As applicable, in each cost-type subaward to:
(A) A domestic U.S. entity ( an entity other than a foreign public entity or a foreign organization); or
i.e.,(B) An organizational unit of a foreign organization if that unit has a place of business in the United States; and
ii. To the maximum extent practicable in each cost-type subaward to either a foreign public entity or an organizational unit of a foreign organization that does not have a place of business in the United States (regardless of whether another organizational unit of that foreign organization has one). However, absent our prior approval, you may not allow that foreign entity or organization to acquire real property or equipment under a subaward.
c. SUB Article IX of this award specifies national policy requirements that you must include, as applicable, in each cost-type subaward.
2. 
Fixed-amount type subawards.a. Sections A through F of SUB Article III of this award specify informational content that you must include in each fixed-amount subaward.
b. SUB Article IX of this award specifies national policy requirements that you must include, as applicable, in each fixed-amount subaward.
c. Section D of SUB Article XII of this award specifies administrative requirements that you must include, as applicable, in any fixed-amount subaward to:
i. A domestic U.S. entity ( an entity other than a foreign public entity or a foreign organization); or
i.e.,ii. An organizational unit of a foreign organization if that unit has a place of business in the United States; and
iii. To the maximum extent practicable to either a foreign public entity or an organizational unit of a foreign organization that does not have a place of business in the United States (regardless of whether another organizational unit of that foreign organization has one). However, absent our prior approval, you may not allow that foreign entity or organization to acquire real property or equipment under a subaward.
3.  You may include other requirements in your subawards that you need in order to meet your responsibilities under this award for performance of the project or program (including portions performed by subrecipients) and compliance with applicable administrative and national policy requirements.
Additional subaward terms and conditions. You must report subaward obligating actions and information on subrecipients' executive compensation as required by REP Article IV of this award.


Section D. Subaward and executive compensation reporting.SUB Article II. Pre-Award and Time of Award Responsibilities. (DECEMBER 2014)
Appendix C to Part 1138APPENDIX1Appendix C to Part 1138—Terms and Conditions for SUB Article III, “Informational Content of Subawards”
Unless modified as provided in § 1138.5, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for SUB Article III.
 You must include in each subaward (and each subsequent amendment to a subaward that alters the amount of the subaward) the information specified in OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1), “Federal Award Identification,” with the clarifications provided in Sections B through G of this article.
Section A. Informational content in general. The “Federal Award Identification Number” and “Federal Award Date” described in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1)(iii) and (iv), respectively, are the award number and award date for this award to you. You must provide the information in a way that makes it clear that the subaward is under this DoD award.
Section B. Federal award identification number and award date.Section C. Amount of Federal funds obligated.1. The “Amount of Federal Funds Obligated by this action by the pass-through entity to the subrecipient” that is described in 2 CFR 200.331(a)(1)(vi) is either:
a. The amount of your obligation to the subrecipient, if the terms and conditions of this award do not require you to provide any cost sharing or matching for the project or program the award supports; or
b. The amount of the Federal share of your subaward obligation if this award does require cost sharing or matching, which in that case is the product of:
i. The Federal share of total project costs under this DoD award to you, as a percentage of those total project costs; and
ii. The total amount of project costs obligated for the subaward action.

Section B. Subrecipient monitoring actions.1.  You must, as part of your post-award monitoring of each subrecipient:
Required monitoring actions under cost-type subawards.a. Review the financial and programmatic information that your subaward terms and conditions require the subrecipient to provide, in accordance with Sections B and C of SUB Article VII of this award.
b. Follow up and ensure that the subrecipient takes timely and appropriate action to remedy deficiencies detected through any means, including audits and on-site reviews.
c. With respect to audits of subrecipients that are required under FMS Article V of this award:
i. Verify that the subrecipient is audited in accordance with those requirements, as applicable (note that Section F of SUB Article IV requires you to include those audit requirements for the subrecipient in the subaward's terms and conditions).
ii. Resolve and issue a management decision for audit findings that pertain to your subaward. Doing so is a requirement under either Section A or B of FMS Article V of this award (Section B requires that explicitly and Section A does so by implementing OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.521, as well as other portions of Subpart F of that part).
iii. Consider whether you need to adjust your own records related to this award based on results of audits, on-site reviews or other monitoring of the subrecipient and, as applicable, notify the award administration office.
2.  OMB guidance in 2 CFR 200.331(e)(1) through (3) describes other actions that may be useful as part of your subrecipient monitoring program, depending on the outcomes of the pre-award risk assessment you conducted in accordance with Section B of SUB Article II.
Other monitoring actions. With respect to any subaward under this award, you must:
Section C. Remedies and subaward suspension or termination.1. Consider whether you need to take any remedial action if you determine that the subrecipient is noncompliant with an applicable Federal statute or regulation or the terms and conditions of your subaward, as described in Section D of SUB Article VIII.
2. Provide a notice of termination to the subrecipient if you terminate its subaward unilaterally for any reason prior to the end of the period of performance.
3. In the case of suspension or termination of a subaward prior to the end of the period of performance, allow or disallow subaward costs in accordance with Section D of OAR Article III.
Section D. Subaward closeout.1. You will close out each subaward when you either:
a. Determine that the subrecipient has completed its programmatic performance under the subaward and all applicable administrative actions; or
b. Terminate the subaward, if you do so prior to the end of the subaward's period of performance.
2. With respect to the closeout of each subaward:
a. You must pay the subrecipient promptly for allowable and reimbursable costs.
b. Consistent with the terms and conditions of the subaward, you must make a settlement for any upward or downward adjustments to the Federal share of costs after you receive the information you need from the subrecipient to close out the subaward.
c. You should complete the closeout of the subaward no later than one year after you receive and accept the final reports and other information from the subrecipient that you need to close out the subaward.


SUB Article X. Subrecipient Monitoring and Other Post-Award Administration. (DECEMBER 2014)
Appendix K to Part 1138APPENDIX1Appendix K to Part 1138—Terms and Conditions for SUB Article XI, “Requirements Concerning Subrecipients' Lower-Tier Subawards”
Unless modified as provided in § 1138.5, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for SUB Article XI.
 This article specifies requirements you must include in any cost-type subaward under which you determine that the subrecipient of your subaward may make lower-tier cost-type subawards to other entities. Paragraph G.1 of SUB Article XII specifies requirements related to fixed-amount type subawards at lower tiers.
Section A. Purpose. Your cost-type subaward terms and conditions must require your subrecipient, with respect to each lower-tier cost-type subaward that it makes, to:
Section B. Requirements for lower-tier subawards.1. Ensure that the lower-tier transaction is a subaward, rather than a procurement, by making the determination that SUB Article I of this award requires you to make for your subawards.
2. Conduct the pre-award risk assessment of its intended subrecipient that Section B of SUB Article II of this award requires you to make for your subawards.
3. Include in any cost-type subaward it makes at the next tier:
a. The informational content that SUB Article III specifies;
b. The administrative requirements that SUB Articles IV through VIII of this award specify;
c. The national policy requirements that SUB Article IX of this award specifies, as applicable; and
d. The requirements of this article if the next-tier subrecipient may make even lower-tier cost-type subawards to other entities.
4. Carry out the subrecipient monitoring and other post-award administration responsibilities specified in SUB Article X of this award.


SUB Article XI. Requirements Concerning Subrecipients' Lower-Tier Subawards. (DECEMBER 2014)
Appendix L to Part 1138APPENDIX1Appendix L to Part 1138—Terms and Conditions for SUB Article XII, “Fixed-Amount Subawards”
Unless modified as provided in § 1138.5 or 1138.1205, a DoD Component's general terms and conditions must use the following wording for SUB Article XII.
Section A. Limitations on use.1. You may not use a fixed-amount subaward:
a. If the total value over the life of the subaward will exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.
b. Unless the project or program scope is specific, with definite outcomes, and you are able to establish a reasonable estimate of the actual costs of accomplishing those outcomes.
c. If you will predetermine a set amount or percentage of cost sharing or matching that the subrecipient must provide under the subaward.
d. If the subrecipient will acquire any real property or equipment under the subaward.
2. For fixed-amount subawards not prohibited by paragraph 1 of this section and except as provided in Section B of this article, you must obtain our prior approval before making a fixed-amount type of subaward.
a. If Section B of FMS Article IV requires you to obtain our prior approval before you make any subaward, and you do not identify the subaward as a fixed-amount subaward when you obtain that approval, then you must subsequently request separate approval before awarding it as a fixed-amount type of subaward.
b. If a subaward is identified as a fixed-amount type of subaward in the budget you submit for our approval, then our approval of the budget is the required prior approval.
 You are not required to obtain our prior approval before using a fixed-amount type of subaward if:
Section B. Fixed-amount subawards that do not require prior approval.1. The subaward is to either:
a. A foreign public entity; or
b. An organizational unit of a foreign organization, if that unit does not have a place of business in the United States, regardless of whether another organizational unit of that foreign organization has one.
2. You determine that the portion of the project or program under this award which the subrecipient will be carrying out under the subaward has one or more specific outcomes with the following characteristics:
a. You can define the outcomes well enough to specify them at the time you make the subaward. Note that:
i. Outcomes are distinct from inputs needed to achieve the outcomes, such as amounts or percentages of time that subrecipient employees or other participants will spend on the project or program.
ii. The inherently unpredictable nature of basic or applied research makes it rarely, if ever, possible to define specific research outcomes in advance, which makes fixed-amount subawards inappropriate for research. Note that technical performance reports serve to document research outcomes but are not themselves outcomes, notwithstanding the definition of “performance goals” in OMB guidance at 2 CFR 200.76.
b. The accomplishment of each outcome will be observable and verifiable by you when it occurs, so that you will not need to rely solely on the subrecipient's assurance of that accomplishment.
c. The subrecipient associates its estimated costs with outcomes in the proposal it submits to you, and you are confident that the costs of accomplishment of the outcomes will equal or exceed the subaward amount. This requires either that you have a high degree of confidence:
i. In your estimate of the costs associated with accomplishing the well-defined and observable outcomes, based on the prospective subrecipient's proposal (and using the applicable cost principles in FMS Article III as a guide); or
ii. That those costs will be within a finite range, rather than a specific amount, so that you may provide an amount of funding under the subaward that does not exceed the lower end of the range, with the provision that the subrecipient agrees to provide any balance above that amount that ultimately is needed to accomplish the outcomes. Your subaward then would include a term or condition to reflect the subrecipient's agreement to provide that balance (which would be in an amount to be post-determined, when the outcomes are accomplished). Note that this is distinct from a situation in which you predetermine a set amount or percentage of cost sharing or matching that the subrecipient must provide under its subaward, a situation in which paragraph A.1.c of this article prohibits use of a fixed-amount subaward.
3. a. The subaward is based on a fixed rate per unit of outcome (or “unit cost”) and you have both the confidence:
i. That is described in paragraph B.2.c of this article in the estimated costs associated with each unit of outcome; and
ii. In the subrecipient's guarantee that it can accomplish at least the number of units of outcome on which your total subaward amount will be based ( the product of the unit cost and the number of units of outcome the subrecipient guarantees to accomplish).
i.e.,b. Note, however, that not every fixed rate subaward is also a fixed-amount subaward. If you have confidence in the unit cost but not also in the subrecipient's ability to guarantee the number of units of outcome that it will accomplish, then you should set a not-to-exceed award amount based on the number of units desired and reduce the subaward amount at the end if the subrecipient accomplishes fewer than that number. Examples of activities for which it may be appropriate to award this type of fixed rate subaward that is not a fixed-amount subaward include:
i. A clinical trial for which the unit cost is the cost of treating each participant. The not-to-exceed amount would be based on the number of participants the subrecipient planned to recruit and the final award on the number who actually participated, documentation for which would be subject to audit.
ii. Labor costs for performance of a portion of the project or program under this award by a for-profit entity that treats its indirect cost rate as proprietary information. The unit cost in that case may be “loaded” labor rates for the entity's employees that include indirect costs. The final award amount would depend on the number of labor hours the entity's employees expended under the subaward, documentation for which may be audited without exposing proprietary details associated with the actual costs.
 You must include in each fixed-amount subaward the informational content, other than the indirect cost rate, that is described in SUB Article III of this award.
Section C. Informational content of fixed-amount subawards.Section D. Terms and conditions addressing administrative requirements.1.  This section:
General.a. Specifies the minimum set of terms and conditions (in lieu of the more extensive set specified in SUB Articles IV through X for cost-type subawards) addressing administrative requirements that you must include in each fixed-amount subaward:
i. To an entity other than a foreign organization, as applicable; and
ii. To the maximum extent practicable, to a foreign organization.
b. Does not preclude the inclusion of other requirements that you need in order to meet your responsibilities under this award for performance of the project or program and compliance with applicable administrative and national policy requirements.
2. 
Financial and program management requirements.a.  For a subaward to other than a for-profit entity, your subaward must require the subrecipient to include the information specified in paragraph B.1 of FMS Article I in its financial management system, for the purposes of the non-Federal audits required by paragraph 2.d of this section.
Financial management system standards.b.  Your payments must be based on accomplishment of the outcomes and associated costs that you used to establish the award amount, rather than on subrecipient expenditures for project or program purposes. Milestone payments before the end of the subaward's period of performance may be appropriate if there are outcomes that the subrecipient will accomplish at different times during that period.
Payments.c.  If our prior approval was required under paragraph A.2 of this article for use of a fixed-amount type of subaward, then you must:
Revision of budget and program plans.i. Request our prior approval for any change in scope or objective of the subaward; and
ii. Include a requirement in the subaward for the subrecipient to request that approval through you.
d.  You must include the requirement for non-Federal audits described in Section F of SUB Article IV. The audits are intended to focus on compliance with the performance requirements in the subaward terms and conditions and not to review actual costs as they would for a cost-type subaward.
Non-Federal audits.3. 
Property requirements.a. . If the subrecipient will be accountable for federally owned property, you must include the property management system, use, and disposition requirements described in Sections C and F of SUB Article V that are applicable to federally owned property.
Federally owned propertyb.  You must include the applicable intangible property requirements described in Section G of SUB Article V.
Intangible property.4.  You must include requirements for reporting that you need in order to meet your responsibilities under this award for reporting to us.
Reporting requirements.5. 
Other administrative requirements.a.  You must include the substance of the provision in Section C of OAR Article I in any subaward you make under this award. The provision must require the subrecipient's disclosure of any evidence directly to the Inspector General, DoD.
Integrity-related information.b. .
Records retention and accessi. You must include the requirements for records retention and access in paragraph A.3 and Sections B and F of OAR Article II, as applicable, if the subaward is to an institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, State, local government, or Indian tribe. You may not impose any other records retention or access requirements on the subrecipient.
ii. You must include the corresponding requirements of 32 CFR 34.42 if the subaward is to a for-profit entity.
c.  You must include:
Remedies and termination.i. The requirements concerning remedies and termination that are described in paragraphs D.1 and 2 of SUB Article VIII;
ii. Provisions addressing any hearing and appeal rights the subrecipient has, as described in Section E of SUB Article VIII; and
iii. Terms and conditions addressing adjustment of the amount of the subaward if it is terminated before the subrecipient accomplishes all of the specified outcomes.
d.  You must include requirements concerning continuing responsibilities for audits and records retention and access that are described in paragraphs B.1 and 3 of OAR Article VII.
Continuing responsibilities.e.  You should consider including requirements concerning collection of amounts due, as described in Section F of SUB Article VIII.
Collection of amounts due. You must include in the terms and conditions of each fixed-amount subaward the national policy requirements that SUB Article IX of this award specifies, as applicable.
Section E. National policy requirements for fixed-amount subawards. You must carry out the subrecipient monitoring and post-award administration actions specified in SUB Article X, as applicable.
Section F. Subrecipient monitoring and other post-award administration.Section G. Fixed-amount subawards at lower tiers.1. 
Authority.a. If Section B of this article authorizes you to use a fixed-amount type of subaward without our prior approval in some situations, a cost-type subaward that you make may authorize the subrecipient to use fixed-amount subawards at the next lower tier in those same situations without our prior approval.
b. If you wish to allow a subrecipient of a cost-type subaward to use fixed-amount subawards at the next tier in other situations ( situations in which this article requires you to obtain our prior approval before using a fixed-amount type of subaward), your subaward terms and conditions must require the subrecipient to submit a request through you to obtain our prior approval for use of that type of subaward.
i.e.,2.  If your subrecipient is authorized to use lower-tier fixed-amount subawards, as described in paragraphs 1.a and b of this section, your subaward's terms and conditions must:
Subaward requirements.a. Require the subrecipient, before it makes any lower-tier fixed-amount subaward, to:
i. Ensure that the lower-tier transaction is a subaward, rather than a procurement, by making the determination that SUB Article I of this award requires you to make for your subawards.
ii. Conduct the pre-award risk assessment of its intended subrecipient that Section B of SUB Article II of this award requires you to make for your subawards.
b. Include the requirements specified in Sections A through F of this article.

1401.330SECTION1§ 1401.330   How and when must I identify workplaces?(a) You must identify all known workplaces under each DOI award. A failure to do so is a violation of your drug-free workplace requirements. You may identify the workplaces—

1401.401SECTION1§ 1401.401   Whom in the DOI does a recipient who is an individual notify about a criminal drug conviction?The DOI is not designating a central location for the receipt of these reports.

N1402.113SECTION1§ 1402.113   What are the mandatory disclosure requirements?In addition to the disclosures required under 2 CFR 200.112 and 200.113, non-Federal entities, including applicants for all Federal awards, must disclose in writing any potential or actual conflict of interest to the DOI awarding agency or pass-through entity. Non-Federal entities and applicants must also disclose any outstanding unresolved matters with the Government Accountability Office or an Office of Inspector General when submitting a proposal and through the life of the award as needed. Unresolved items are those items that do not have an approved (by the awarding agency) corrective action plan in place and remain open.


1402.114-1402.203SECTION1§§ 1402.114-1402.203   [Reserved]CSUBPARTSubpart C—Pre-Federal Award Requirements and Contents of Federal Awards1402.204SECTION1§ 1402.204   What are the merit review requirements for competitive awards?The requirements in this section apply to competitive grants and cooperative agreements unless otherwise authorized by Federal statute. Merit review procedures must be described or incorporated by reference in NOFOs (see 2 CFR part 200, appendix I, and 2 CFR 200.203). Pre-award considerations for both discretionary competitive and noncompetitive awards shall take into account the alignment of the award's purpose, goals, and measurement with the current DOI Government Performance and Results Act Strategic Plan including, the mission statement, vision, values, goals, objectives, strategies, and performance metrics therein, unless otherwise prohibited by statute.
(a)  Competition is expected in awarding discretionary funds, unless otherwise directed by Congress. When grants and cooperative agreements are awarded competitively, DOI requires that the competitive process be fair and impartial, that all applicants be evaluated only on the criteria stated in the announcement, and that no applicant receive an unfair competitive advantage. All competitive funding announcements, and all modifications/amendments to those announcements, must be posted on  ().
Competition in grant and cooperative agreement awards.Grants.govwww.grants.gov(b)  Bureaus and offices must conduct reviews of applications submitted in response to the announcement and for selecting applicants for award following established merit review procedures. Bureaus and offices must conduct comprehensive, impartial, and objective review of applications based on the criteria contained in the announcement by individuals who have no conflicts of interest with respect to the competing proposal/applications or applicants. Bureaus and offices must ensure reviewers are qualified, applications are scored on the basis of announced criteria, consideration is given to the level of applicant risk and past performance, applications are ranked, and funding determinations are made.
Independent objective evaluation of financial assistance applications and proposals.(c)  Bureaus and offices must develop an Evaluation and Selection Plan in concert with the notice of funding opportunity to ensure consistency, and to outline and document the selection process. The Evaluation and Selection Plan should be finalized prior to the release of the notice of funding opportunity. An Evaluation and Selection Plan is comprised of five basic elements:
Evaluation and Selection Plan for notice of funding opportunities.(1) Merit review factors and sub-factors;
(2) A rating system ( adjectival, color coding, numerical, or ordinal);
e.g.,(3) Evaluation standards or descriptions that explain the basis for assignment of the various rating system grades/scores;
(4) Program policy factors; and
(5) The basis for selection.
(d)  Bureaus and offices must initially screen applications/proposals to ensure that they meet the standards in paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section before they are subjected to a detailed evaluation utilizing a merit review process specified in paragraph (h) of this section. The review system should include three phases: Initial Screening, Threshold Screening, and a Merit Review Evaluation Screening. Bureaus and offices may remove an application from funding consideration if it does not pass the basic eligibility screening per paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section.
Basic review standards.(e)  Bureaus and offices may return applications/proposals that are incomplete or otherwise fail to meet the requirements of the  announcement to the applicant to be corrected, modified, or supplemented, or may reject the application/proposal outright. Until the application/proposal meets the substantive requirements of the announcement and this part, it shall not be given detailed evaluation. Bureaus and offices may use discretion to determine the length of time for applicants to resolve application deficiencies.
Completeness.Grants.gov(f)  Bureaus and offices must consider the timeliness of the application submission. Applications that are submitted beyond the announced deadline date must be removed from the review process.
Timeliness.(g)  Bureaus and offices are responsible for screening applications and proposals for the adequacy of the budget and compliance with statutory and other requirements. The SF-424 and budget information (SF-424A, SF-424C, or OMB-approved alternate budget data collection) must be reviewed according to Department of the Interior policy.
Threshold Screening.(h)  This is the final review stage where the technical merit of the application/proposal is reviewed. In the absence of a program rule or statutory requirement, program officials shall develop criteria that include all aspects of technical merit. Bureaus and offices shall develop criteria that are conceptually independent of each other, but all-encompassing when taken together. While criteria will vary, the basic criteria shall focus reviewers' attention on the project's underlying merit ( significance, approach, and feasibility). The criteria shall focus not only on the technical details of the proposed project but also on the broader importance or potential impact of the project. The criteria shall be easily understood.
Merit Review Evaluation Screening.i.e.,(i)  Bureaus and offices must also consider risk thresholds during application/proposal review process. Elements to be considered may include organization; single audit submissions, past performance; availability of necessary resources, equipment, or facilities; financial strength and management capabilities; and procurement procedures; or procedures for selecting and monitoring subrecipients or sub-vendors, if applicable. For all non-Federal entities that receive an award, the Financial Assistance Officer must document the risk analysis.
Risk assessments.(j)  Upon receipt of a Memorandum of Appointment, each proposal evaluator and advisor must sign and return a Conflict of Interest Certificate to the Financial Assistance Officer. If an actual or potential conflict of interest exists, the appointee may not evaluate or provide advice on a potential applicant's proposal until the conflict has been resolved or mitigated. Further, each proposal evaluator or advisor must agree to comply with any notice or limitation placed on the application. Upon completion of the review, the proposal evaluator or advisor shall return or destroy all copies of the application and accompanying proposals (or abstracts) to DOI; and unless authorized by the Financial Assistance Officer or agency designee, the reviewer shall not contact the non-Federal entity concerning any aspect of the application.

Whenever a recipient is seeking DOI's approval to use award funds to purchase an interest in real property, the OMB-approved governmentwide data elements for collection of real property reporting information, as of October 29, 2019, SF-429-B, Request to Acquire, Improve, or Furnish, or approved alternate standardized data collection, must be submitted to the bureau or office. The Financial Assistance Officer is responsible for ensuring that this requirement is met. All aspects of the purchase must be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to purchases of land or interests in land.
Approval prior to land purchases.(b)  (1) Unless a waiver valuation applies in accordance with 49 CFR 24.102(c), land or interests in land that will be acquired under the award must be appraised in accordance with the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions, (UASFLA or the “Yellow Book”), developed and promulgated by the Interagency Land Acquisition Conference, 1155 15th Street NW, Suite 1111, Washington, DC 20005, by a real property appraiser licensed or certified by the State or States in which the property is located.

Bureaus and offices shall ensure that funds are not disbursed for purchases of land or interests in land without an appraisal accompanied by a written appraisal review report that complies with standards approved by AVSO. Where appraisals are required to support federally assisted land acquisitions, AVSO has oversight responsibilities for these appraisals, including those purchased through financial assistance actions in the various grant programs within the Department. AVSO will coordinate with grant programs to conduct periodic internal control review of appraisal and appraisal review reports prepared in conjunction with grant applications for land acquisition.

(c)  Land to be acquired under an award that is located outside the United States must be appraised by an independent real property appraiser licensed or certified in the country in which the property is located in accordance with any in-country appraisal standards, if they exist, or with International Valuation Standards, when such appraisals are available and financially feasible. Otherwise, the non-Federal entity must use the most widely accepted business practice for property valuation in the country where the property is located and provide to the awarding DOI bureau or office a detailed explanation of the methodology used to determine value.
Foreign land acquisition.(d)  (1) For all financial assistance actions where real property is acquired under the Federal award, the recipient must submit reports on the status of the real property. Bureaus and offices must ensure recipients receive written notification of those reporting requirements, including reporting frequency/schedule, report content requirements, and submission instructions, at the time of award.
Requirements for recipient reporting on real property purchases.(2) If the interest in the land will be held for less than 15 years, reports must be submitted annually. If the interest in the land will be held for 15 years or more, then the recipient must submit the first report within one year of the period of performance end date of the award and then, at a minimum, every five years thereafter.
(3) The reports must be submitted to the Financial Assistance Officer within the period of performance of the award. After the end of the period of performance, reports must be submitted to a designated individual. Each bureau must have a process in place to designate specific individuals to receive, and review and accept the report.
(4) Recipients must use the OMB-approved governmentwide data elements for collection of real property reporting information, as of October 29, 2019, the Real Property Status Report Standard Form (SF) 429-A, General Reporting, to report status of land or interests in land under Federal financial assistance awards. Bureaus or offices may request to use an equivalent reporting format. The Director, Office of Grants Management must approve alternate equivalent formats.
(5) Reports must include, at a minimum, sufficient information to demonstrate that all conditions imposed on the land use are being met, and a signed certification to that fact by the recipient of the financial assistance award.
(6) The Financial Assistance Officer must indicate the reporting schedule, including due dates, in the award document. The schedule must conform with the frequency required in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. For awards issued prior to October 29, 2019, the recipient must contact the program to establish due dates for reports going forward. If there is already a reporting schedule in place, then the recipient and the program shall ensure that the schedule is updated to conform with this part prior to the due date of the next scheduled report.


1402.330-1402.413SECTION1§§ 1402.330-1402.413   [Reserved]1402.414SECTION1§ 1402.414   What are the negotiated indirect cost rate deviation policies?(a) This section establishes DOI policies, procedures, and decision making criteria for using an indirect cost rate that differs from the non-Federal entity's negotiated rate or approved rate for DOI awards. These are established in accordance with 2 CFR 200.414(c)(3) or (f).
(b) DOI accepts indirect cost rates that have been reduced or removed voluntarily by the proposed recipient of the award, on an award-specific basis.
(c) For all deviations to the Federal negotiated indirect cost rate, including statutory, regulatory, programmatic, and voluntary, the basis of direct costs against which the indirect cost rate is applied must be:
(1) The same base identified in the recipient's negotiated indirect cost rate agreement, if the recipient has a federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement; or
(2) The Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC) base, in cases where the recipient does not have a federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement or, with prior approval of the awarding bureau or office, when the recipient's federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement base is only a subset of the MTDC (such as salaries and wages) and the use of the MTDC still results in an overall reduction in the total indirect cost recovered. MTDC is the base defined by 2 CFR 200.68, Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC).
(d) In cases where the recipient does not have a federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement, DOI will not use a modified rate based upon total direct cost or other base not identified in the federally negotiated indirect cost rate agreement or defined within 2 CFR 200.68.
(1)  In accordance with 2 CFR 200.414(c)(1), a Federal agency must use a rate other than the Federal negotiated rate where required by Federal statute or regulation. For such instances within DOI, the official award file must document the specific statute or regulation that required the deviation.
Indirect cost rate deviation required by statute or regulation.(2)  Instances where the recipient elects to use a rate lower than the federally negotiated indirect cost rate, and uses the balance of the unrecovered indirect costs to meet a cost-share or matching requirement required by the program and/or statute, are not considered a deviation from 2 CFR 200.414(c), as the federally negotiated indirect cost rate is being applied under the agreement in order to meet the terms and conditions of the award.
Indirect cost rate reductions used as cost-share.(3)  Bureaus and offices with DOI approved deviations in place prior to October 29, 2019 are not required to resubmit those for reconsideration following the procedures in this paragraph (d)(3). The following requirements apply for review, approval, and posting of programmatic indirect cost rate waivers:
Programmatic indirect cost rate deviation approval process.(i)  Programs that have instituted a program-wide requirement and governance process for deviations from federally negotiated indirect cost rates may qualify for a programmatic deviation approval.
Program qualifications.(ii)  Deviation requests must be submitted by the responsible senior program manager to the DOI Office of Grants Management. The request for deviation approval must include a description of the program, and the governance process for negotiating and/or communicating to recipients the indirect cost rate requirements under the program. The program must make its governance documentation, rate deviations, and other program information publicly available.
Deviation requests.(iii)  Programmatic deviations must be approved, in writing, by the Director, Office of Grants Management. Approved deviations will be made publicly available.
Approvals.(4)  On any single award, an applicant and/or proposed recipient may elect to reduce or eliminate the indirect cost rate applied to costs under that award. The election must be voluntary and cannot be required by the awarding official, NOFO, program, or other non-statutory or non-regulatory requirements. For these award-specific and voluntary reductions, DOI can accept the lower rate provided the notice of award clearly documents the recipient's voluntary election. Once DOI has accepted the lower rate, that rate will apply for the duration of the award.
Voluntary indirect cost rate reduction.(5)  In accordance with 2 CFR 200.405, indirect costs not recovered due to deviations to the federally negotiated rate are not allowable for recovery via any other means.

(a)  The DDO must receive the Dispute no later than 30 calendar days from the date the Agency Decision is electronically sent to the Affected Entity. The DDO will dismiss any Dispute received after the 30-day period unless the DDO grants an extension of time to submit the Dispute. The Affected Entity must submit a written request for extension to the DDO before the expiration of the 30-day period. The DDO may grant a one-time extension of up to 30 calendar days when justified by the situation, which may include the unusual complexity of the Dispute or because of exigent circumstances.
Timeliness.(b)  The Affected Entity must submit the Dispute electronically via email to the DDO, with a copy to the AO, using the email addresses specified in the Agency Decision within the 30-day period stated in paragraph (a) of this section.

(a)  If the Dispute was timely submitted, the notice of acknowledgement may identify any additional information or documentation that is required for a thorough consideration of the Dispute. The notice should provide no more than 30 calendar days for the Affected Entity to provide the requested information. If it is not feasible to identify such information or documentation in the notice the DDO may request it at a later point in time prior to issuance of the Dispute decision.
Timely Disputes.(b)  If the DDO did not receive the Dispute within the required 30-day period, or any extension of it, the DDO will notify the Affected Entity that the Dispute is being dismissed as untimely and the Agency Decision of the AO becomes final. The dismissal of an untimely Dispute constitutes the final agency action. In appropriate circumstances, the DDO may, as a matter of discretion, consider an untimely Dispute if doing so would be in the interests of fairness and equity.
Untimely Disputes.[85 FR 61575, Sept. 30, 2020]


N1500.17SECTION1§ 1500.17   Determination of Dispute.(a) In determining the merits of the Dispute, the DDO will consider the record related to the Agency Decision, any documentation that the Affected Entity submits with its Dispute, any additional documentation submitted by the Affected Entity in response to the DDO's request under § 1500.16(a), and any other information the DDO determines is relevant to the Dispute provided the DDO gives notice of that information to the Affected Entity. The Affected Entity may not on its own initiative submit any additional documents except in the support of a request for reconsideration under paragraph (c) of this section.
(b) The DDO will issue the Dispute decision within 180 calendar days from the date the Dispute is received by the DDO unless a longer period is necessary based on the complexity of the legal, technical, and factual issues presented. The DDO will notify the Affected Entity if the expected decision will not be issued within the 180-day period and if feasible will indicate when the decision is expected to be issued. The DDO will issue the Dispute decision electronically and advise the Affected Entity of procedures for requesting reconsideration. The DDO's decision will constitute the final agency action unless the Affected Entity electronically petitions the DDO for reconsideration within 15 calendar days of issuance of the DDO Decision. The Affected Entity must include a detailed statement of the factual and legal grounds warranting reversal or modification of the DDO decision. In addition, the Affected Entity may submit additional documents that were not previously provided to the DDO.
(c) If a petition for reconsideration is submitted, the DDO's will advise the Affected Entity within 15 calendar days of receipt of the petition whether the DDO Decision will be reconsidered. The DDO will issue this determination electronically. DDO's will only grant a reconsideration petition if the Affected Entity provides relevant and material evidence that was not available to the Affected Entity at the time the Dispute was submitted or to correct a clear and prejudicial error of fact or law. Denial of a petition for reconsideration constitutes final agency action and the DDO will advise the Affected Entity of the reasons for denying the reconsideration in writing.
(d) If the DDO grants a reconsideration petition, the DDO will issue a revised DDO Decision within 30 calendar days of acceptance of the reconsideration petition unless a longer period is necessary based on the complexity of the legal, technical, and factual issues presented. The DDO will issue the revised DDO Decision electronically. The revised DDO Decision and any new material considered by the DDO in making the revised DDO Decision will become part of the record of the Dispute. The revised DDO Decision will constitute final agency action.
(e) The DDO may consider untimely filed reconsideration petitions only if necessary, to correct a DDO Decision that is manifestly unfair and inequitable in light of relevant and material evidence that the Affected Entity could not have discovered during the 15-calendar day period for petitioning for reconsideration. This evidence must be submitted within six months of the date of the DDO Decision. The DDO will advise the Affected Entity within 30 days of receipt of an untimely filed reconsideration petition whether the DDO will accept the petition. Denial of an untimely filed reconsideration petition constitutes final agency action.[85 FR 61575, Sept. 30, 2020, as amended at 87 FR 30397, May 19, 2022]

JSUBPARTSubpart J—Statutory Disqualification and Reinstatement Under the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act1532.1100SECTION1§ 1532.1100   What does this subpart do?This subpart explains how the EPA administers section 306 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) (42 U.S.C. 7606) and section 508 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) (33 U.S.C. 1368), which disqualify persons convicted for certain offenses under those statutes (see § 1532.1105), from eligibility to receive certain contracts, subcontracts, assistance, loans and other benefits (see coverage under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4 and subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180). It also explains: the procedures for seeking reinstatement of a person's eligibility under the CAA or CWA; the criteria and standards that apply to EPA's decision-making process; and requirements of award officials and others involved in Federal procurement and nonprocurement activities in carrying out their responsibilities under the CAA and CWA.


1532.1105SECTION1§ 1532.1105   Does this subpart apply to me?(a) Portions of this subpart apply to you if you are convicted, or likely to be convicted, of any offense under section 7413(c) of the CAA or section 1319(c) of the CWA.
(b) Portions of this subpart apply to you if you are the EPA debarring official, a Federal procurement or nonprocurement award official, a participant in a Federal procurement or nonprocurement program that is precluded from entering into a covered transaction with a person disqualified under the CAA or CWA, or if you are a Federal department or agency anticipating issuing an exception to a person otherwise disqualified under the CAA or CWA.


1532.1110SECTION1§ 1532.1110   How will a CAA or CWA conviction affect my eligibility to participate in Federal contracts, subcontracts, assistance, loans and other benefits?If you are convicted of any offense described in § 1532.1105, you are automatically disqualified from eligibility to receive any contract, subcontract, assistance, sub-assistance, loan or other nonprocurement benefit or transaction that is prohibited by a Federal department or agency under the Governmentwide debarment and suspension system (i.e. covered transactions under subpart A through I of 2 CFR part 180, or prohibited awards under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4), if you:
(a) Will perform any part of the transaction or award at the facility giving rise to your conviction (called the violating facility); and
(b) You own, lease or supervise the violating facility.


1532.1115SECTION1§ 1532.1115   Can the EPA extend a CAA or CWA disqualification to other facilities?The CAA specifically authorizes the EPA to extend a CAA disqualification to other facilities that are owned or operated by the convicted person. The EPA also has authority under subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, or under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, to take discretionary suspension and debarment actions on the basis of misconduct leading to a CAA or CWA conviction, or for activities that the EPA debarring official believes were designed to improperly circumvent a CAA or CWA disqualification.


1532.1120SECTION1§ 1532.1120   What is the purpose of CAA or CWA disqualification?As provided for in Executive Order 11738 (3 CFR, 1973 Comp., p. 799), the purpose of CAA and CWA disqualification is to enforce the Federal Government's policy of undertaking Federal procurement and nonprocurement activities in a manner that improves and enhances environmental quality by promoting effective enforcement of the CAA or CWA.


1532.1125SECTION1§ 1532.1125   How do award officials and others know if I am disqualified?If you are convicted under these statutes, the EPA enters your name and address and that of the violating facility into the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) as soon as possible after the EPA learns of your conviction. In addition, the EPA enters other information describing the nature of your disqualification. Federal award officials and others who administer Federal programs consult the EPLS before entering into or approving procurement and nonprocurement transactions. Anyone may access the EPLS through the internet, currently at  


http://www.epls.gov.1532.1130SECTION1§ 1532.1130   How does disqualification under the CAA or CWA differ from a Federal discretionary suspension or debarment action?(a) CAA and CWA disqualifications are exclusions mandated by statute. In contrast, suspensions and debarments imposed under subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180 or under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, are exclusions imposed at the discretion of Federal suspending or debarring officials. This means that if you are convicted of violating the CAA or CWA provisions described under § 1532.1105, ordinarily your name and that of the violating facility is placed into the EPLS before you receive a confirmation notice of the listing, or have the opportunity to discuss the disqualification with, or seek reinstatement from, the EPA.
(b) CAA or CWA disqualification applies to both the person convicted of the offense, and to the violating facility during performance of an award or covered transaction under the Federal procurement and nonprocurement suspension and debarment system. It is the EPA's policy to carry out CAA and CWA disqualifications in a manner which integrates the disqualifications into the Governmentwide suspension and debarment system. Whenever the EPA determines that the risk presented to Federal procurement and nonprocurement activities on the basis of the misconduct which gives rise to a person's CAA or CWA conviction exceeds the coverage afforded by mandatory disqualification, the EPA may use its discretionary authority to suspend or debar a person under subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, or under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4.


1532.1135SECTION1§ 1532.1135   Does CAA or CWA disqualification mean that I must remain ineligible?You must remain ineligible until the EPA debarring official certifies that the condition giving rise to your conviction has been corrected. If you desire to have your disqualification terminated, you must submit a written request for reinstatement to the EPA debarring official and support your request with persuasive documentation. For information about the process for reinstatement see §§ 1532.1205 and 1532.1300.


1532.1140SECTION1§ 1532.1140   Can an exception be made to allow me to receive an award even though I may be disqualified?(a) After consulting with the EPA debarring official, the head of any Federal department or agency (or designee) may exempt any particular award or a class of awards with that department or agency from CAA or CWA disqualification. In the event an exemption is granted, the exemption must:
(1) Be in writing; and
(2) State why the exemption is in the paramount interests of the United States.
(b) In the event an exemption is granted, the exempting department or agency must send a copy of the exemption decision to the EPA debarring official for inclusion in the official record.


1532.1200SECTION1§ 1532.1200   How will I know if I am disqualified under the CAA or CWA?There may be several ways that you learn about your disqualification. You are legally on notice by the statutes that a criminal conviction the CAA or CWA automatically disqualifies you. As a practical matter, you may learn about your disqualification from your defense counsel, a Federal contract or award official, or from someone else who sees your name in the EPLS. As a courtesy, the EPA will attempt to notify you and the owner, lessor or supervisor of the violating facility that your names have been entered into the EPLS. The EPA will inform you of the procedures for seeking reinstatement and give you the name of a person you can contact to discuss your reinstatement request.


1532.1205SECTION1§ 1532.1205   What procedures must I follow to have my procurement and nonprocurement eligibility reinstated under the CAA or CWA?(a) You must submit a written request for reinstatement to the EPA debarring official stating what you believe the conditions were that led to your conviction, and how those conditions have been corrected, relieved or addressed. Your request must include documentation sufficient to support all material assertions you make. The debarring official must determine that all the technical and non-technical causes, conditions and consequences of your actions have been sufficiently addressed so that the Government can confidently conduct future business activities with you, and that your future operations will be conducted in compliance with the CAA and CWA.
(b) You may begin the reinstatement process by having informal discussions with the EPA representative named in your notification of listing. Having informal dialogue with that person will make you aware of the EPA concerns that must be addressed. The EPA representative is not required to negotiate conditions for your reinstatement. However, beginning the reinstatement process with informal dialogue increases the chance of achieving a favorable outcome, and avoids unnecessary delay that may result from an incomplete or inadequate reinstatement request. It may also allow you to resolve your disqualification by reaching an agreement with the EPA debarring official under informal procedures. Using your informal option first does not prevent you from submitting a formal reinstatement request with the debarring official at any time.


1532.1210SECTION1§ 1532.1210   Will anyone else provide information to the EPA debarring official concerning my reinstatement request?If you request reinstatement under § 1532.1205, the EPA debarring official may obtain review and comment on your request by anyone who may have information about, or an official interest in, the matter. For example, the debarring official may consult with the EPA Regional offices, the Department of Justice or other Federal agencies, or state, tribal or local governments. The EPA debarring official will make sure that you have an opportunity to address important allegations or information contained in the administrative record before making a final decision on your request for reinstatement.


1532.1215SECTION1§ 1532.1215   What happens if I disagree with the information provided by others to the EPA debarring official on my reinstatement request?(a) If your reinstatement request is based on factual information (as opposed to a legal matter or discretionary conclusion) that is different from the information provided by others or otherwise contained in the administrative record, the debarring official will decide whether those facts are genuinely in dispute, and material to making a decision. If so, a fact-finding proceeding will be conducted in accordance with 2 CFR 180.830 through 180.840, and the debarring official will consider the findings when making a decision on your reinstatement request.
(b) If the basis for your disagreement with the information contained in the administrative record relates to a legal issue or discretionary conclusion, or is not a genuine dispute over a material fact, you will not have a fact-finding proceeding. However, the debarring official will allow you ample opportunity to support your position for the record and present matters in opposition to your continued disqualification. A summary of any information you provide orally, if not already recorded, should also be submitted to the debarring official in writing to assure that it is preserved for the debarring official's consideration and the administrative record.


1532.1220SECTION1§ 1532.1220   What will the EPA debarring official consider in making a decision on my reinstatement request?(a) The EPA debarring official will consider all information and arguments contained in the administrative record in support of, or in opposition to, your request for reinstatement, including any findings of material fact.
(b) The debarring official will also consider any mitigating or aggravating factors that may relate to your conviction or the circumstances surrounding it, including any of those factors that appear in 2 CFR 180.860 that may apply to your situation.
(c) Finally, if disqualification applies to a business entity, the debarring official will consider any corporate or business attitude, policies, practices and procedures that contributed to the events leading to conviction, or that may have been implemented since the date of the misconduct or conviction. You can obtain any current policy directives issued by the EPA that apply to CAA or CWA disqualification or reinstatement by contacting the Office of the EPA Debarring Official, U.S. EPA, Office of Grants and Debarment (3901R), 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20460.


1532.1225SECTION1§ 1532.1225   When will the EPA debarring official make a decision on my reinstatement request?(a) The EPA debarring official will make a decision regarding your reinstatement request under § 1532.1205(a), when the administrative record is complete, and he or she can determine whether the condition giving rise to the CAA or CWA conviction has been corrected-usually within 45 days of closing the administrative record.
(b) A reinstatement request is not officially before the debarring official while you are having informal discussions under § 1532.1205(b).


1532.1230SECTION1§ 1532.1230   How will the EPA debarring official notify me of the reinstatement decision?The EPA debarring official will notify you of the reinstatement decision in writing, using the same methods for communicating debarment or suspension action notices under 2 CFR 180.615.


1532.1300SECTION1§ 1532.1300   Can I resolve my eligibility status under terms of an administrative agreement without having to submit a formal reinstatement request?(a) The EPA debarring official may, at any time, resolve your CAA or CWA eligibility status under the terms of an administrative agreement. Ordinarily, the debarring official will not make an offer to you for reinstatement until after the administrative record for decision is complete, or contains enough information to enable him or her to make an informed decision in the matter.
(b) Any resolution of your eligibility status under the CAA or CWA resulting from an administrative agreement must include a certification that the condition giving rise to the conviction has been corrected.
(c) The EPA debarring official may enter into an administrative agreement to resolve CAA or CWA disqualification issues as part of a comprehensive criminal plea, civil or administrative agreement when it is in the best interest of the United States to do so.


1532.1305SECTION1§ 1532.1305   What are the consequences if I mislead the EPA in seeking reinstatement or fail to comply with my administrative agreement?(a) Any certification of correction issued by the EPA debarring official whether the certification results from a reinstatement decision under §§ 1532.1205(a) and 1532.1230, or from an administrative agreement under §§ 1532.1205(b) and 1532.1300, is conditioned upon the accuracy of the information, representations or assurances made during development of the administrative record.
(b) If the EPA debarring official finds that he or she has certified correction of the condition giving rise to a CAA or CWA conviction or violation on the basis of a false, misleading, incomplete or inaccurate information; or if a person fails to comply with material condition of an administrative agreement, the EPA debarring official may take suspension or debarment action against the person(s) responsible for the misinformation or noncompliance with the agreement as appropriate. If anyone provides false, inaccurate, incomplete or misleading information to EPA in an attempt to obtain reinstatement, the EPA debarring official will refer the matter to the EPA Office of Inspector General for potential criminal or civil action.


1532.1400SECTION1§ 1532.1400   How may I appeal a decision denying my request for reinstatement?(a) If the EPA debarring official denies your request for reinstatement under the CAA or CWA, you can ask for review of the debarring official's decision in two ways:
(1) You may ask the debarring official to reconsider the decision for material errors of fact or law that you believe will change the outcome of the matter; and/ or
(2) You may request the Director, Office of Grants and Debarment (OGD Director), to review the debarring official's denial within 30 days of your receipt of the debarring official's decision under § 1532.1230 or paragraph (a)(1) of this section. However, the OGD Director can reverse the debarring official's decision denying reinstatement only where the OGD Director finds that there is a clear error of material fact or law, or where the OGD Director finds that the debarring official's decision was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.
(b) A request for review under this section must be in writing and state the specific findings you believe to be in error and include the reasons or legal bases for your position.
(c) A review under this section is solely within the discretion of the OGD Director.
(d) The OGD Director must notify you of his or her decision under this section, in writing, using the notice procedures at 2 CFR 180.615 and 180.975.


1532.1500SECTION1§ 1532.1500   If I am reinstated, when will my name be removed from the EPLS?If your eligibility for procurement and nonprocurement participation is restored under the CAA or CWA, whether by decision, appeal, or by administrative agreement, the EPA will remove your name and that of the violating facility from the EPLS, generally within 5 working days of your reinstatement.


1532.1600SECTION1§ 1532.1600   What definitions apply specifically to actions under this subpart?In addition to definitions under subpart A through I of 2 CFR part 180 that apply to this part as a whole, the following two definitions apply specifically to CAA and CWA disqualifications under this subpart:
(a) Person means an individual, corporation, partnership, association, state, municipality, commission, or political subdivision of a state, or any interstate body.
(b) Violating facility means any building, plant, installation, structure, mine, vessel, floating craft, location or site of operations that gives rise to a CAA or CWA conviction, and is a location at which or from which a Federal contract, subcontract, loan, assistance award or other covered transactions may be performed. If a site of operations giving rise to a CAA or CWA conviction contains or includes more than one building, plant, installation, structure, mine, vessel, floating craft, or other operational element, the entire location or site of operation is regarded as the violating facility unless otherwise limited by the EPA.

1600.10SECTION1§ 1600.10   What does this part do?This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by this part, as the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) regulations for non-procurement debarment and suspension. It thereby gives regulatory effect for DFC to the OMB guidance as supplemented by this part.

1600.20SECTION1§ 1600.20   Does this part apply to me?This part and, through this part, pertinent portions of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180 (see table at 2 CFR 180.100(b)) apply to you if you are a—
(a) Participant or principal in a “covered transaction” (see 2 CFR part 180, subpart B, and the definition of “non-procurement transaction” at 2 CFR 180.970);
(b) Respondent in a DFC suspension or debarment action;
(c) DFC suspending or debarring official; and

1600.220SECTION1§ 1600.220   What contracts and subcontracts are covered transactions?First-tier procurements ( primary contracts) under a covered nonprocurement transaction are covered transactions. Although the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.220(c) allows a Federal agency to do so (see also optional lower tier coverage in the figure in the appendix to 2 CFR part 180), DFC does not extend coverage of nonprocurement suspension and debarment requirements beyond first-tier procurement under a covered nonprocurement transaction. Moreover, for purposes of determining whether a procurement contract is included as a covered transaction, the threshold in 2 CFR 180.220(b) is increased from $25,000 to the “simplified acquisition threshold” as defined in 48 CFR 2.101.

1800.1SECTION1§ 1800.1   Authority.The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) awards grants and cooperative agreements under the authority of 51 U.S.C. 20113 (e), the National Aeronautics and Space Act. This part 1800 is issued under the authority of 51 U.S.C. 20113 (e), Pub. L. 97-258, 96 Stat. 1003 (31 U.S.C. 6301 ), and 2 CFR part 200.






et seq.1800.2SECTION1§ 1800.2   Purpose.This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through F and applicable appendices of 2 CFR part 200 (as revised in April 2024), as supplemented by this part, as the NASA policies and procedures for uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for Federal awards. It thereby gives regulatory effect for NASA to the OMB guidance as supplemented by this part.

N1800.3SECTION1§ 1800.3   Applicability.(a) This part establishes policies and procedures for grants and cooperative agreements awarded by NASA to non-Federal entities, for-profit organization, foreign organizations, and foreign public entities as allowed by 2 CFR 200.101. For supplemental guidance, NASA has adopted section numbers that correspond to those in the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200.
(1) Non-Federal entities must follow the policies and procedures appearing in subparts A through F and applicable appendices of 2 CFR part 200 and as supplemented by this part.
(2) Foreign organizations and foreign public entities must follow the policies and procedures appearing in subparts A through E and applicable appendices of 2 CFR part 200 and as supplemented by this part.
(3) U.S. and foreign for-profit organizations must follow the policies and procedures appearing in subparts A through D and applicable appendices of 2 CFR part 200 and as supplemented by this part. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR parts 30 and 31, takes precedence over the cost principles in 2 CFR part 200, subpart E for Federal awards to U.S. and foreign for-profit organizations.
(b) Throughout this part, the term “award” refers to both “grant” and “cooperative agreement” unless otherwise indicated.
(c)(1) In general, research with foreign organizations and foreign public entities will not be conducted through grants or cooperative agreements, but instead will be accomplished on a no-exchange-of-funds basis. In these cases, NASA enters into agreements undertaking projects of international scientific collaboration. NASA's policy on performing research with foreign organizations and foreign public entities on a no-exchange-of-funds basis is set forth at NASA FAR Supplement (NFS) 1835.016-70 and 1835.016-72. In rare instances, NASA may enter into an international agreement under which funds will be transferred to a foreign recipient.
(2) Grants or cooperative agreements awarded to foreign organizations and foreign public entities are made on an exceptional basis only. Awards require the prior approval of the Headquarters Office of International and Interagency Relations and the Headquarters Office of the General Counsel. Requests to issue awards to foreign organizations are to be coordinated through the Office of Procurement, Procurement and Grants Policy Division.

JSUBPARTSubpart J—Limited Denial of Participation2424.1100SECTION1§ 2424.1100   What is a limited denial of participation?A limited denial of participation excludes a specific person from participating in a specific program, or programs, within a HUD field office's geographic jurisdiction, for a specific period of time. A limited denial of participation is normally issued by a HUD field office, but may be issued by a Headquarters office. The decision to impose a limited denial of participation is discretionary and based on the best interests of the federal government. 


2424.1105SECTION1§ 2424.1105   Who may issue a limited denial of participation?The Secretary designates HUD officials who are authorized to impose a limited denial of participation, affecting any participant and/or their affiliates, except mortgagees approved by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). 


2424.1110SECTION1§ 2424.1110   When may a HUD official issue a limited denial of participation?(a) An authorized HUD official may issue a limited denial of participation against a person, based upon adequate evidence of any of the following causes:
(1) Approval of an applicant for insurance would constitute an unsatisfactory risk;
(2) There are irregularities in a person's past performance in a HUD program;
(3) The person has failed to maintain the prerequisites of eligibility to participate in a HUD program;
(4) The person has failed to honor contractual obligations or to proceed in accordance with contract specifications or HUD regulations;
(5) The person has failed to satisfy, upon completion, the requirements of an assistance agreement or contract;
(6) The person has deficiencies in ongoing construction projects;
(7) The person has falsely certified in connection with any HUD program, whether or not the certification was made directly to HUD;
(8) The person has committed any act or omission that would be cause for debarment under 2 CFR 180.800;
(9) The person has violated any law, regulation, or procedure relating to the application for financial assistance, insurance, or guarantee, or to the performance of obligations incurred pursuant to a grant of financial assistance or pursuant to a conditional or final commitment to insure or guarantee;
(10) The person has made or procured to be made any false statement for the purpose of influencing in any way an action of the Department; or

(b) Filing of a criminal Indictment or Information shall constitute adequate evidence for the purpose of limited denial of participation actions. The Indictment or Information need not be based on offenses against HUD.
(c) Imposition of a limited denial of participation by any other HUD office shall constitute adequate evidence for a concurrent limited denial of participation. Where such a concurrent limited denial of participation is imposed, participation may be restricted on the same basis without the need for an additional conference or further hearing.
(d) An affiliate or organizational element may be included in a limited denial of participation solely on the basis of its affiliation, and regardless of its knowledge of or participation in the acts providing cause for the sanction. The burden of proving that a particular affiliate or organizational element is currently responsible and not controlled by the primary sanctioned party (or by an entity that itself is controlled by the primary sanctioned party) is on the affiliate or organizational element.

2424.1120SECTION1§ 2424.1120   How long may a limited denial of participation last?A limited denial of participation may remain in effect up to 12 months.

(b) Of the cause(s) under § 2424.1110 for the sanction;
(c) Of the potential effect of the sanction, including the length of the sanction and the HUD program(s) and geographic area affected by the sanction;
(d) Of the right to request, in writing, within 30 days of receipt of the notice, a conference under § 2424.1130; and

The official or designee who imposed the sanction shall preside. At the conference, you may appear with a representative and may present all relevant information and materials to the official or designee. Within 20 days after the conference, or within 20 days after any agreed-upon extension of time for submission of additional materials, the official or designee shall, in writing, advise you of the decision to terminate, modify, or affirm the limited denial of participation. If all or a portion of the remaining period of exclusion is affirmed, the notice of affirmation shall advise you of the opportunity to contest the notice and to request a hearing before a Departmental Hearing Officer.

Again, you have 30 days from the expiration of the 20-day period to request this hearing. If you request a hearing before the Departmental Hearing Officer, you must submit your request to the Debarment Docket Clerk, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., B-133 Portals 200, Washington DC 20410-0500.
(b) You may skip the conference with the official and you may request a hearing before a Departmental Hearing Officer. This must also be done within 30 days after receiving a notice of limited denial of participation. If you opt to have a hearing before a Departmental Hearing Officer, you must submit your request to the Debarment Docket Clerk, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., B-133 Portals 200, Washington DC 20410-0500. The hearing before the Departmental Hearing Officer is more formal than the conference before the sanctioning official described above. The Departmental Hearing Officer will conduct the hearing in accordance with 24 CFR part 26, subpart A. The Departmental Hearing Officer will issue findings of fact and make a recommended decision. The sanctioning official will then make a final decision, as promptly as possible, after the Departmental Hearing Officer's recommended decision is issued. The sanctioning official may reject the recommended decision or any findings of fact, only after specifically determining that the decision or any of the facts are arbitrary, capricious, or clearly erroneous.
(c) In deciding whether to terminate, modify, or affirm a limited denial of participation, the Departmental official or designee may consider the factors listed at 2 CFR 180.860. The Departmental Hearing Officer may also consider the factors listed at 2 CFR 180.860 in making any recommended decision. 


2424.1135SECTION1§ 2424.1135   Do Federal agencies coordinate limited denial of participation actions?Federal agencies do not coordinate limited denial of participation actions. As stated in § 2424.1100, a limited denial of participation is a HUD-specific action and applies only to HUD activities. 


2424.1140SECTION1§ 2424.1140   What is the scope of a limited denial of participation?The scope of a limited denial of participation is as follows:
(a) A limited denial of participation generally extends only to participation in the program under which the cause arose. A limited denial of participation may, at the discretion of the authorized official, extend to other programs, initiatives, or functions within the jurisdiction of an Assistant Secretary. The authorized official, however, may determine that where the sanction is based on an indictment or conviction, the sanction shall apply to all programs throughout HUD.
(b) For purposes of this subpart, participation includes receipt of any benefit or financial assistance through grants or contractual arrangements; benefits or assistance in the form of loan guarantees or insurance; and awards of procurement contracts.
(c) The sanction may be imposed for a period not to exceed 12 months, and shall be effective within the geographic jurisdiction of the office imposing it, unless the sanction is imposed by an Assistant Secretary or Deputy Assistant Secretary, in which case the sanction may be imposed on either a nationwide or a more restricted basis. 


2424.1145SECTION1§ 2424.1145   May HUD impute the conduct of one person to another in a limited denial of participation?For purposes of determining a limited denial of participation, HUD may impute conduct as follows:
(a)  HUD may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual associated with an organization, to that organization when the improper conduct occurred in connection with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of that organization, or with the organization's knowledge, approval, or acquiescence. The organization's acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.
Conduct imputed from an individual to an organization.(b)  HUD may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any organization to an individual, or from one individual to another individual, if the individual to whom the improper conduct is imputed participated in, had knowledge of, or had reason to know of the improper conduct.
Conduct imputed from an organization to an individual or between individuals.(c)  HUD may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of one organization to another organization when the improper conduct occurred in connection with a partnership, joint venture, joint application, association, or similar arrangement, or when the organization to whom the improper conduct is imputed has the power to direct, manage, control, or influence the activities of the organization responsible for the improper conduct. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval, or acquiescence. 


Conduct imputed from one organization to another organization.2424.1150SECTION1§ 2424.1150   What is the effect of a suspension or debarment on a limited denial of participation?If you have submitted a request for a hearing pursuant to § 2424.1130 of this subpart, and you also receive, pursuant to subpart G or H of this part, a notice of proposed debarment or suspension that is based on the same transaction(s) or the same conduct as the limited denial of participation, as determined by the debarring or suspending official, the following rules shall apply:
(a) During the 30-day period after you receive a notice of proposed debarment or suspension, during which you may elect to contest the debarment under 2 CFR 180.815, or the suspension pursuant to 2 CFR 180.720, all proceedings in the limited denial of participation, including discovery, are automatically stayed.
(b) If you do not contest the proposed debarment pursuant to 2 CFR 180.815, or the suspension pursuant to 2 CFR 180.720, the final imposition of the debarment or suspension shall also constitute a final decision with respect to the limited denial of participation, to the extent that the debarment or suspension is based on the same transaction(s) or conduct as the limited denial of participation.
(c) If you contest the proposed debarment pursuant to 2 CFR 180.815, or the suspension pursuant to 2 CFR 180.720, then:
(1) Those parts of the limited denial of participation and the debarment or suspension based on the same transaction(s) or conduct, as determined by the debarring or suspending official, shall be immediately consolidated before the debarring or suspending official;
(2) Proceedings under the consolidated portions of the limited denial of participation shall be stayed before the hearing officer until the suspending or debarring official makes a determination as to whether the consolidated matters should be referred to a hearing officer. Such a determination must be made within 90 days of the date of the issuance of the suspension or proposed debarment, unless the suspending/debarring official extends the period for good cause.
(i) If the suspending or debarring official determines that there is a genuine dispute as to material facts regarding the consolidated matter, the entire consolidated matter will be referred to the hearing officer hearing the limited denial of participation, for additional proceedings pursuant to 2 CFR 180.750 or 180.845.
(ii) If the suspending or debarring official determines that there is no dispute as to material facts regarding the consolidated matter, jurisdiction of the hearing officer under 2 CFR part 2424, subpart J, to hear those parts of the limited denial of participation based on the same transaction[s] or conduct as the debarment or suspension, as determined by the debarring or suspending official, will be transferred to the debarring or suspending official, and the hearing officer responsible for hearing the limited denial of participation shall transfer the administrative record to the debarring or suspending official.
(3) The suspending or debarring official shall hear the entire consolidated case under the procedures governing suspensions and debarments, and shall issue a final decision as to both the limited denial of participation and the suspension or debarment. 


2424.1155SECTION1§ 2424.1155   What is the effect of a limited denial of participation on a suspension or a debarment?The imposition of a limited denial of participation does not affect the right of the Department to suspend or debar any person under this part. 


2424.1160SECTION1§ 2424.1160   May a limited denial of participation be terminated before the term of the limited denial of participation expires?If the cause for the limited denial of participation is resolved before the expiration of the 12-month period, the official who imposed the sanction may terminate it. 


2424.1165SECTION1§ 2424.1165   How is a limited denial of participation reported?When a limited denial of participation has been made final, or the period for requesting a conference pursuant to § 2424.1130 has expired without receipt of such a request, the official imposing the limited denial of participation shall notify the Director of the Compliance Division in the Departmental Enforcement Center of the scope of the limited denial of participation.

The Foundation's implementation document, the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide, may be found at: .
http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappNSF's implementation includes the following deviation from the Uniform Guidance:
Award Cash Management System—NSF is continuing collection of award financial information through the implementation of the Award Cash Management Service (ACM$) and the Program Income Worksheet. ACM$ replaced the NSF Federal Financial Report (FFR) and the NSF FastLane Cash Request process with a single web based user interface. ACM$ is used to collect award level detail financial information at the time of each payment request submitted by the awardee institution. The Program Income Worksheet is used to collect program income financial information from awardee institutions on an annual basis. ACM$ and the Program Income Worksheet utilize approved government-wide data elements from the FFR for the collection of financial information as provided for in the Uniform Guidance paragraph 505(c) and prescribed in 2 CFR 200.327. The requirement for Federal agencies to use the FFR data elements for cash management and financial reporting was publically announced in  on August 13, 2008.

(2) You may request that the SBA Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) review the debarring official's decision to debar you within 30 days of your receipt of the debarring official's decision under § 180.870 or paragraph (a)(1) of this section. However, OHA may reverse the debarring official's decision only where OHA finds that the decision is based on a clear error of material fact or law, or where OHA finds that the debarring official's decision was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. You may appeal the debarring official's decision without requesting reconsideration, or you may appeal the decision of the debarring official on reconsideration. The procedures governing OHA appeals are set forth in 13 CFR part 134.
(b) A request for review under this section must be in writing; state the specific findings you believe to be in error; and include the reasons or legal bases for your position.
(c) OHA, in its discretion, may stay the debarment pending review of the debarring official's decision.

This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Section 2455, Public Law 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327).

(d) NEH grants officer, agreements officer, or other official authorized to enter into any type of nonprocurement transaction that is a covered transaction; 


3369.30SECTION1§ 3369.30   What policies and procedures must I follow?The NEH policies and procedures that you must follow are the policies and procedures specified in each applicable section of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as that section is supplemented by the section in this part with the same section number. The contracts that are covered transactions, for example, are specified by section 220 of the OMB guidance (, 2 CFR 180.220) as supplemented by section 220 in this part (, § 3369.220). For any section of OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR 180 that has no corresponding section in this part, NEH policies and procedures are those in the OMB guidance.

N3474.15SECTION1§ 3474.15   Contracting with faith-based organizations and nondiscrimination.Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 15701, Mar. 4, 2024.2024030447(a) This section establishes responsibilities that grantees and subgrantees have in selecting contractors to provide direct Federal services under a program of the Department. Grantees and subgrantees must ensure compliance by their subgrantees with the provisions of this section and any implementing regulations or guidance.
(b)(1) A faith-based organization is eligible to contract with grantees and subgrantees, including States, on the same basis as any other private organization.
(2)(i) In selecting providers of goods and services, grantees and subgrantees, including States—
(A) May not discriminate for or against a private organization on the basis of the organization's religious character, motives, or affiliation, or lack thereof, or on the basis of conduct that would not be considered grounds to favor or disfavor a similarly situated secular organization; and
(B) Must ensure that the award of contracts is free from political interference, or even the appearance of such interference, and is done on the basis of merit, not on the basis of religion or religious belief, or lack thereof.
(ii) Notices or announcements of award opportunities and notices of award or contracts must include language substantially similar to that in appendices A and B, respectively, to 34 CFR part 75.
(3) No grant document, agreement, covenant, memorandum of understanding, policy, or regulation that is used by a grantee or subgrantee in administering Federal financial services from the Department may require faith-based organizations to provide assurances or notices if they are not required of non-faith-based organizations. Any restrictions on the use of grant funds must apply equally to faith-based and non-faith-based organizations. All organizations that participate in Department programs or services, including organizations with religious character, motives, or affiliation, must carry out eligible activities in accordance with all program requirements, including those prohibiting the use of direct Federal financial assistance to engage in explicitly religious activities, subject to any accommodations that are granted to organizations on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the Constitution and laws of the United States, including Federal civil rights laws.
(4) No grant document, agreement, covenant, memorandum of understanding, policy, or regulation that is used by a grantee or subgrantee may disqualify faith-based organizations from participating in Department-funded programs or services on the basis of the organization's religious character, motives, or affiliation, or lack thereof, or on the basis of conduct that would not be considered grounds to disqualify a similarly situated secular organization.
(5) Nothing in this section may be construed to preclude the Department from making an accommodation with respect to one or more program requirements on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the Constitution and laws of the United States, including Federal civil rights laws.
(6) Neither a State nor the Department may disqualify an organization from participating in any Department program for which it is otherwise eligible on the basis of the organization's indication that it may request an accommodation with respect to one or more program requirements, unless the organization has made clear that the accommodation is necessary to its participation and the Department has determined that it would deny the accommodation.






(c)(1) The provisions of 34 CFR 75.532 and 76.532 that apply to a faith-based organization that is a grantee or subgrantee also apply to a faith-based organization that contracts with a grantee or subgrantee, including a State.
(2) The requirements referenced under paragraph (c)(1) of this section do not apply to a faith-based organization that provides goods or services to a beneficiary under a program supported only by indirect Federal financial assistance, as defined in 34 CFR 75.52(c)(3) and 76.52(c)(3).
(d)(1) A private organization that provides direct Federal services under a program of the Department and engages in explicitly religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization, must offer those activities separately in time or location from any programs or services funded by the Department through a contract with a grantee or subgrantee, including a State. Attendance or participation in any such explicitly religious activities by beneficiaries of the programs and services supported by the contract must be voluntary.
(2) The limitations on explicitly religious activities under paragraph (d)(1) of this section do not apply to a faith-based organization that provides services to a beneficiary under a program supported only by indirect Federal financial assistance, as defined in 34 CFR 75.52(c)(3) and 76.52(c)(3).
(e)(1) A faith-based organization that contracts with a grantee or subgrantee, including a State, will retain its independence, autonomy, right of expression, religious character, and authority over its governance. A faith-based organization that receives Federal financial assistance from the Department does not lose the protections of law.
(2) A faith-based organization that contracts with a grantee or subgrantee, including a State, may, among other things—
(i) Retain religious terms in its name;
(ii) Continue to carry out its mission, including the definition, development, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs;
(iii) Use its facilities to provide services without concealing, removing, or altering religious art, icons, scriptures, or other symbols from these facilities;
(iv) Select its board members on the basis of their acceptance of or adherence to the religious tenets of the organization; and
(v) Include religious references in its mission statement and other chartering or governing documents.
(f) A private organization that contracts with a grantee or subgrantee, including a State, may not discriminate against a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary in the provision of program goods or services, or in outreach activities related to such goods or services, on the basis of religion or religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice. However, an organization that participates in a program funded by indirect Federal financial assistance need not modify its program activities to accommodate a beneficiary who chooses to expend the indirect aid on the organization's program.


(g) A religious organization's exemption from the Federal prohibition on employment discrimination on the basis of religion, in section 702(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-1(a), is not forfeited when the organization contracts with a grantee or subgrantee. (h) No grantee or subgrantee receiving funds under any Department program or service shall construe these provisions in such a way as to advantage or disadvantage faith-based organizations affiliated with historic or well-established religions or sects in comparison with other religions or sects.

e.g.,(viii) Grantees or subgrantees for which compliance with these requirements would conflict with, or materially undermine the ability to protect or enforce, other intellectual property rights or obligations of the grantee or subgrantee, in existence or under development, including those provided under 15 U.S.C. 1051,  18 U.S.C. 1831-1839, and 35 U.S.C. 200,

3485.12SECTION1§ 3485.12   What does this part do?(a)(1) The Department of Education (the “Department” or “ED”) adopts subparts A through I of the Office of Management and Budget guidance in 2 CFR part 180. Thus, this part gives regulatory effect to the OMB guidance and supplements the guidance as needed for the Department. This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR part 1986 Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR part 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Section 2455, Pub. L. 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327).
(2) The table of contents for this part contains only those sections in part 3485 that include supplements to the guidance in part 180 and new sections needed to implement the guidance for the Department's programs. In those sections of the OMB guidance that are supplemented, the section in part 3485 includes both the text of the OMB guidance that is not affected by the change and any additional paragraphs that need to be added to the OMB guidance. For example, § 180.220 of this title contains only paragraphs (a) and (b). The text of § 3485.220, which supplements § 180.220 to extend lower-tier transactions to certain transactions below the primary tier, includes both the text of paragraph (a) and (b) of § 180.220 and the text of added paragraph (c).
(3) In those sections in part 180 that do not have paragraph designations and that the Department supplements, the section in this part implementing the OMB guidance designates the undesignated paragraph from part 180 as paragraph (a) and the first supplemental paragraph as paragraph (b). For example, 2 CFR 180.330 includes an undesignated lead in paragraph and two subparagraphs designated (a) and (b). In § 3485.330, the undesignated paragraph in 2 CFR 180.330 is designated paragraph (a) and the two subparagraphs are designated paragraphs (1) and (2). The added paragraphs are designated paragraph (b) and (c).

The contracts that are covered transactions, for example, are specified in § 3485.220. Section 180.205 of this title does not require supplementation, so it is not included in the table of contents for this part and is not separately stated in this part.
(Authority: E.O. 12549 (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189); E.O. 12689 (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235); sec. 2455, Pub. L. 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327 (31 U.S.C. 6101 note); 20 U.S.C. 1082, 1094, 1221e-3, and 3474)


NASUBPARTSubpart A—General3485.137SECTION1§ 3485.137   May the Department grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?(a) Yes, the Secretary delegates to the ED Deciding Official the authority under this section to grant an exception permitting an excluded person to participate in a particular covered transaction.
(b) If the ED Deciding Official grants an exception, the exception must be in writing and state the reason(s) for deviating from the Governmentwide policy in Executive Order 12549.
(Authority: E.O. 12549 (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189); E.O. 12689 (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235); sec. 2455, Pub. L. 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327 (31 U.S.C. 6101 note); 20 U.S.C. 1082, 1094, 1221e-3, and 3474)


NBSUBPARTSubpart B—Covered Transactions3485.220SECTION1§ 3485.220   Are any procurement contracts included as covered transactions?(a) Covered transactions under this part—
(1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a Federal agency; but
(2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded by non-Federal participants in nonprocurement covered transactions.
(b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered transaction if any of the following applies:
(1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement transaction that is covered under § 180.210 of this title, and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.
(2) The contract requires the consent of an official of a Federal agency. In that case, the contract, regardless of the amount, always is a covered transaction, and it does not matter who awarded it. For example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the Appendix to Part 3485—Covered Transactions.
(3) The contract is for Federally-required audit services.
(4) The contract is to perform services as a third party servicer in connection with a title IV, HEA program.
(c) In addition to the contracts covered under 2 CFR 180.220(b) of the OMB guidance, this part applies to any contract, regardless of tier, that is awarded by a contractor, subcontractor, supplier, consultant, or its agent or representative in any transaction, if the contract is to be funded or provided by ED under a covered nonprocurement transaction and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000. This extends the coverage of the ED nonprocurement suspension and debarment requirements to all lower tiers of subcontracts under covered nonprocurement transactions, as permitted under the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.220(c) (see optional lower tier coverage in the figure in Appendix A to Part 3485—Covered Transactions).

NCSUBPARTSubpart C—Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions3485.310SECTION1§ 3485.310   What must I do if a Federal agency excludes a person with whom I am already doing business in a covered transaction?(a) You as a participant may continue covered transactions with an excluded person if the transactions were in existence when the agency excluded the person. However, you are not required to continue the transactions, and you may consider termination. You should make a decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.
(b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any excluded person, unless another Federal agency responsible for the transaction grants an exception under § 180.135 of this title or ED grants an exception under § 3485.137.
(c) If you are a title IV, HEA participant, you may not continue a title IV, HEA transaction with an excluded person after the effective date of the exclusion unless permitted by 34 CFR 668.26, 682.702, or 668.94, as applicable.

N3485.315SECTION1§ 3485.315   May I use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction?(a) You as a participant may continue to use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction if you were using the services of that person in the transaction before the person was excluded. However, you are not required to continue using that person's services as a principal. You should make a decision about whether to discontinue that person's services only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.
(b) You may not begin to use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction unless another Federal agency responsible for the transaction grants an exception under § 180.135 of this title or, if ED took the action, an ED deciding official grants an exception under § 3485.137.
(c) If you are a title IV, HEA participant—
(1) You may not renew or extend the term of any contract or agreement for the services of an excluded person as a principal with respect to a title IV, HEA transaction; and
(2) You may not continue to use the services of that excluded person as a principal under this kind of an agreement or arrangement more than 90 days after you learn of the exclusion or after the close of the Federal fiscal year in which the exclusion takes effect, whichever is later.

N3485.330SECTION1§ 3485.330   What methods must I use to pass requirements down to participants at lower tiers with whom I intend to do business?(a) Before entering into a covered transaction with a participant at the next lower tier, you must require that participant to—
(1) Comply with this subpart as a condition of participation in the transaction. You must do so using the method specified in paragraph (b) of this section; and
(2) Pass the requirement to comply with this subpart to each person with whom the participant enters into a covered transaction at the next lower tier.
(b) To communicate the requirements in this part to a participant, you must include a term or condition in the transaction that requires the participant's compliance with part 180, subpart C, of this title, as adopted at § 3485.12, and requires the participant to include a similar term or condition in lower-tier covered transactions.
(c) The failure of a participant to include a requirement to comply with Subpart C of 2 CFR part 180 in the agreement with a lower tier participant does not affect the lower tier participant's responsibilities under this part.

You are not required to continue the transactions, however, and you may consider termination. You should make a decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper.
(b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any excluded person, or under which an excluded person is a principal, unless you obtain an exception under § 3485.137.

(2) You may request a review by the EAC's debarment appeals body (DAP), which is composed of the Executive Director, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Operating Officer.

A request to review the debarring official's decision to debar you must be made within 30 days of your receipt of the debarring official's decision under § 180.870 or paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

You may appeal the debarring official's decision without requesting reconsideration, or you may appeal the decision of the debarring official on reconsideration.
(b) A request for review under this section must be in writing; prominently state on the envelope or other cover and at the top of the first page “Debarment Appeal;” state the specific findings you believe to be in error; and include the reasons or legal bases for your position.

(c) After the circulation vote of the EAC Commissioners has been certified, either the Commission debarring official or the DAP must notify you of their decision under this section, in writing, using the notice procedures set forth at §§ 180.615 and 180.975.
(d) [Reserved]
(e) Nothing in this part prohibits the EAC from delegating the appeal review process to another Federal agency through a memorandum of understanding or interagency agreement.
